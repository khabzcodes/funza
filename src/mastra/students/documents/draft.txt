Number patterns,

sequences and series

3.1 Number patterns

```
A list of numbers in order is called a number pattern or number sequence.
```
```
We need at least three numbers in the list to work out if the numbers form a
pattern. If we only have two numbers, we cannot be sure what the pattern is.
```
```
For example, if we have the list 2; 4; ... many different number patterns are
possible:
```
```
The pattern could be 2; 4; 6; ... add 2 to each number to get the next number
```
```
OR 2; 4; 8; ... multiply each number by 2 to get the next
number
```
```
OR 2; 4; 2; 4; ... repeat the pattern
```
```
A single number in a pattern or sequence is called a term.
```
```
Term 1 is written as T 1 , term 2 is written as T 2 and so on. The number of the term
shows its position in the sequence.
```
```
T 10 is the 10th term in the sequence.
Tn is the nth term in a sequence.

**1.** Look at the number pattern 3; 8; 13; ... 
    T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5
    3 8 13 ...

```
+5 +5 +5 +5
```
```
If we keep adding 5 to each term we get the next term:
T 4 = 13 + 5 = 18; T 5 = 23; T 6 = 28, etc.
```
**2.** Look at the number pattern 5; 15; 45; ... 
    T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5
    5 15 45 ...

```

```
In this pattern, each term is multiplied by 3 to get the next term.
So T 4 = 45 × 3 = 135; T 5 = 405; T 6 = 1 215, and so on.
```
**3.** Look at the sequence: 1; 4; 9; ...
T 1 = 1^2 ; T 2 = 2^2 ; T 3 = 3^2
These are all perfect square numbers. Each number is the number of
    the term squared.
So T 4 = (4)^2 = 16; T 5 = (5)^2 = 25; T 6 = (6)^2 = 36, and so on.

```
It is important to learn to recognise square numbers.
```
3.2 Arithmetic sequences

```
Arithmetic sequence is a sequence where the common difference (d)
between consecutive terms is constant.
```
```
T 2 – T 1 = T 3 – T 2 = Tn – Tn–1 = d (common difference)

2 Given the sequence: 5; 9; 13; 17 ;...
a) Determine the common difference
b) Determine the next two terms
```
```
Solution
d = 9 – 5 = 13 – 9 = 4
T 5 = 17 + 4 = 21 and T 6 = 21 + 4 = 25
```
```
If we use a for the first term T 1 , d for the common difference, then the
general term Tn for an arithmetic sequence is: Tn = a + (n – 1)d

3 Given the sequence 4; 10; 16;...
a) Determine a formula for the nth term of the sequence.
b) Calculate the 50th term.
c) Which term of the sequence is equal to 310
```
```
Solutions
a) a = 4 and d = 10 – 4 = 16 – 10 = 6
Tn = a + (n – 1) d
= 4 + (n – 1) 6
= 4 + 6n – 6
= 6n – 2
```
```
b) T 50 = 6 × 50 – 2
= 300 – 2
= 298
```
```
c) 6n – 2 = 310
6n = 312
n = 52
```
```
or by looking at
the structure, the
numbers are 2 less
than the multiples
of 6
i.e Tn = 6n – 2

**1.** Given the sequence 6; 13; 20; ...
**a)** Determine a formula for the nth term of the sequence.

    determine the value of p.
**b)** Determine the values of the first three terms of the
sequence. (5)
    **[14]**

```
Solutions
```
**1. a)** It is an arithmetic sequence because there is a common difference.
_a_ = 6; _d_ = 7 T _n_ = _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ 3
T _n_ = 6 + ( _n_ – 1)(7)
T _n_ = 7 _n_ – 1 3
**b)** T 21 = 7(21) – 1 = 147 – 1 = 146 3
**c)** 97 = 7 _n_ – 1 3
∴98 = 7 _n_
∴14 = _n_ 3
∴97 is the 14th term of the sequence. (5)
**2. a)** It is an arithmetic sequence: _a_ = 8; _d_ = 5 – 8 = 2 – 5 = – 3
T _n_ = _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_
∴T 15 = 8 + (15 – 1)(–3) 3
T 15 = 8 + 14(–3)
T 15 = 8 – 42 = –34 3
**b)** T _n_ = _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_
- 289 = 8 + ( _n_ – 1)(–3) 3
∴– 289 = 8 – 3 _n_ +3
∴– 300 = –3 _n_
∴100 = _n_ 3 ∴– 289 will be the 100th term (4)
**3. a)** Since this is an arithmetic sequence, you can assume that there is
    a common difference between the terms.
_d_ = T 2 – T 1 = T 3 − T 2
∴(2p – 3) – (1 – p) = ( p + 5) – (2p – 3) 3
3p – 4 = – p + 8 3
4p = 12
p = 3 3
**b)** p = 3
T 1 = 1 – p = 1 – 3 = –2
T 2 = 2p – 3 = 2(3) – 3 = 3 3
T 3 = p + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 3
So the first three terms of the sequence are –2; 3; 8 (5)

3.3 Quadratic sequences

```
At least four numbers are needed to determine whether the sequence is
quadratic or not.
```
```
Consider this number pattern:
```
```
There is no common difference between the numbers.
```
```
The differences are
6; 10; 14; 18.
```
```
Now we can
see if there
is a second
common
difference.
```
```
In this sequence, there is a second common difference of 4.
```
```
The next term will be: T 6 = 54 + (18 + 4) = 76
```
```
A pattern with a common second difference is called a quadratic number
sequence.
```
```
The general formula for any term of a quadratic sequence is: T n = an^2 + bn + c
```
```
T 1 = a + b + c T 2 = 4 a + 2 b + c T 3 = 9 a + 3 b + c T 4 = 16 a + 4 b + c
```
```
1 st difference 3 a + b 5 a + b 7 a + b
```
```
2 nd difference 2 a 2 a
```
```
If T n = an^2 + bn + c
then 2 a is the second difference
3 a + b is T 2 – T 1
a + b + c is the first term
```
```
T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5
6 12 22 36 54
```
```
(T 2 – T 1 ) (T 3 – T 2 ) (T 4 – T 3 ) (T 5 – T 4 )
First difference = 6 = 10 = 14 = 18
```
```
Second difference 10 – 6 14 – 6 18 – 4
= 4 = 4 = 4

```
2 nd common difference is 4
So 2 a = 4 ∴ a = 2

```
Solutions
```
**1. a)** It helps to make a diagram:

```
T 1 T 2 T 3 T 4 T 5
3 13 31 57 91
```
```
(T 2 – T 1 ) (T 3 – T 2 ) (T 4 – T 3 ) (T 5 – T 4 )
First difference = 10 = 18 = 26 = 34
```
```
Second difference 18 – 10 26 – 18 34 – 26
= 8 = 8 = 8
```
```
∴ it is a quadratic sequence.
```
```
2 a = 8 ∴ a = 4 3
3 a + b = 10 ∴3(4) + b = 10
b = –2 3
a + b + c = 3 ∴ 4 + (–2) + c = 3
c = 1 3
∴T n = 4 n^2 – 2 n + 1 3
```
```
b) T 7 = 4(7)^2 – 2(7) + 1 3
= 4(49) – 14 + 1
= 183 3
```
```
c) 241 = 4 n^2 – 2 n + 1
0 = 4 n^2 – 2 n + 1 – 241 3 make the equation = 0 to solve
0 = 4 n^2 – 2 n – 240
0 = 2 n^2 – n – 120 divide through by 2
0 = (2 n + 15)( n – 8) 3
factorise
∴ 2 n + 15 = 0 OR n – 8 = 0
∴ n = –7,5 OR n = 8 3 (9)
```
```
n = –7,5 not possible
because n is the position of the
term so it must be a positive
natural number. ✓
```
```
∴241 is the 8th term
of the sequence.

3.4 Geometric sequences

```
When there is a common ratio (r) between consecutive terms, we can say
this is a geometric sequence.
```
```
If the first term (T 1 ) is a , the common ratio is r , and the general term is T n ,
then:
```
```
r =
```
T__ (^2)
T 1 =
T__ (^3)
T 2 =^
T _n_
___T
_n_ –1
and
Tn = _arn_ –1
Look at the sequence 5; 15; 45; 135; 405; ...
__^155 = 3 __^4515 = 3 and ___^13545 = 3 and so the common ratio is 3.
Therefore the sequence is geometric. To get the next term you multiply the
preceding term by the common ratio.

3.5 Arithmetic and geometric
series
When we add the terms of a sequence together, we form a series.
We use the symbol S _n_ to show the sum of the first n terms of a series.
So S _n_ = T 1 + T 2 + T 3 + T 4 + ... + T _n_
3.5.1 Arithmetic series
The formula is _Sn_ = __ _n_ 2 [2 _a_ + ( _n_ − 1) _d_ ] where S _n_ is the sum of _n_ terms,
_a_ is the first term,
_n_ is the number of terms and
_d_ is the common difference.
Proof
The general term of an arithmetic series is T _n_ = _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_
So S _n_ = T 1 + T 2 + T 3 + T 4 + ... + T _n_
S _n_ = _a_ + [ _a_ + _d_ ] + _a_ + 2 _d_ + ... + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 2) _d_ ] + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] ... equation 1
If we write the series in reverse we get:
S _n_ = [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 2) _d_ ] + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 3) _d_ ] + ... + [ _a_ + _d_ ] + _a_ ...
equation 2
We can add equation 1 and equation 2.
So 2S _n_ = [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + ... +
[2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ]
2S _n_ = _n_ [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ]
S _n_ = __ _n_ 2 [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ]
This formula is provided on the information sheet in the final exam.
Alternative Proof
Or S _n_ = _a_ + [ _a_ + _d_ ] + [ _a_ + 2 _d_ ] + ... + [l – _d_ ] + l ... equation 1
In reverse S _n_ = [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 2) _d_ ] + [ _a_ + ( _n_ – 3) _d_ ] + ... + [ _a_ + _d_ ] + _a_
S _n_ = _l_ + [ _l_ – _d_ ] + [ _l_ – 2 _d_ ] +... + [ _a_ + _d_ ] + _a_ ... equation 2
Adding equation 1 and equation 2
2S _n_ = [ _a_ + _l_ ] + [ _a_ + _l_ ] +... + [ _a_ + _l_ ] _n_ times
2S _n_ = _n_ [ _a_ + l]
∴S _n_ = _n_ __ 2 [ _a_ + l]

S _n_ = _n_ __ 2 [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ]

```
S 20 = __^202 [2(3) + (19)4]
S 20 = 10(6 + 76)
S 20 = 820
The sum of the first 20 terms is 820
```
**2.** _a_ = 5 _d_ = –2 S _n_ = –216 S _n_ = _n_ __ 2 [2 _a_ + ( _n_ – 1) _d_ ] _n_ =?
Substitute into the formula:
–216 = __ _n_ 2 [2(5) + ( _n_ – 1)(–2)]
–216 = __ _n_ 2 [10 + –2 _n_ + 2]
–216 = __ _n_ 2 [12 – 2 _n_ ]
–432 = 12 _n_ – 2 _n_^2
–432 = –2 _n_^2 + 12 _n_ .... Make equation = 0
2 _n_^2 – 12 _n_ – 432 = 0 .... Divide through by 2 (common factor)
_n_^2 – 6 _n_ – 216 = 0 .... Factorise trinomial
( _n_ – 18)( _n_ + 12) = 0
∴ _n_ – 18 = 0 or _n_ + 12 = 0
_n_ = 18 or _n_ = –12
_n_ > 0 ∴ _n_ = 18
∴18 terms of the series add up to –216.

3.5.2 Geometric series

```
The formula is
S n =
```
```
a ( rn − 1)
_______ r − 1 for r > 1 or S n =
a (1 − rn )
_______1 − r for r < 1
```
```
where a is the first term
r is the common ratio
n is the number of terms
S n is the sum of the terms
```
```
Proof:
The general term of a geometric series is T n = arn – 1
```
```
So S n = T 1 + T 2 + T 3 + T 4 + ... + T n
S n = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + arn –2 + ar n –1
```
```
r S n = ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + ... + arn –1 + arn
S n = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + arn –2 + arn –1
```
_____________________________ _r_ S _n_ – S _n_ = – _a_ + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 + 0 + _ar_ (^) _n_
∴ _r_ S _n_ – S _n_ = _arn_ – _a_
S _n_ ( _r_ – 1) = _a_ ( _rn_ – 1)
So S _n_ =
_a_ ( _rn_ –1)
______ _r_ – 1
We can also use for S _n_ =
_a_ (1 – _rn_ )
______1 – _r_ for _r_ < 1
multiply each term by _r_
write down the series again with
like terms under each other
subtract each bottom term from each top term
S _n_ and a are common factors
Divide through by ( _r_ – 1)

Evaluate: 25 + 50 + 100 + ... to 6 terms
```
```
Solution
We need to check if this is an arithmetic series or a geometric series first.
You should see that there is a common ratio of 2 because __^502 = 2 and 100 ___ 50 = 2
r = 2
∴ It is a geometric series and a = 25, n = 6, r = 2
S n =
```
```
a (1 – rn )
______1 – r
```
### S 6 =

```
25(1 – 2^6 )
_______ 1 – 2 26 = 64
```
### S 6 =

```
25(1 – 64)
________– 1
```
### S 6 =

```
25(–63)
______–1
```
### = 1 575

```
So the sum of the first 6 terms of the series is 1 575.

    TWO terms in the sequence.
**b)** Calculate the sum of the first 50 terms of the sequence. (5)

```
[12]
```
```
Solutions
```
**1.** The question asks you to find the sum of the terms from _n_ = 4 to
    _n_ = 70 if the nth term is 2 _n_ – 4.
_a_ = T 1 = 2(4) – 4 = 4 Find the first term _a_
T 2 = 2(5) – 4 = 6
T 3 = 2(6) – 4 = 8
So the sequence is 4; 6; 8; ... and this is an arithmetic series. 3

```
To check d, calculate T 2 – T 1
d = T 2 – T 1 = 6 – 4 = 2
n = (70 – 4) + 1 = 67 3 There are 67 terms
Now we can substitute these values into the formula to find the sum of 67 terms.
```
```
S n = __ n 2 [2 a + ( n – 1) d ]
```
```
S 67 = 67 __ 2 [2(4) + (67 – 1)2]
```
```
S 67 = 33.5 [8 + 132] = 4690
```
```
So ∑
n =4
```
```
70
(2 n – 4) = 4690 3 (3)
```
```
To determine the
number of terms: top
value minus bottom value
plus 1 i.e the number of
terms in this case is
(17 – 3 ) +1 = 15
```
```
Look for two different
sequences in the pattern and
separate them

Functions

## 4.1 What is a function?

```
If you are given a set of x -values, you can work
out the set of y -values or answers that came from
using a given rule on each x -value.
```
```
So there is a relationship between the x -values
and the y -values that is described by the rule.
```
```
The x -values are the input values and the y -values
are the output values. In this flow diagram, the
rule is y = 2 x – 1
```
```
So for every x -value, we multiply it by 2 and subtract 1 to find the corresponding
y -value.

```
© Department of Basic Education 2015 uNiT 4 fuNCTiONS 61
```
**4** Unit Unit **4**

```
We can plot these values on the Cartesian plane.
```
```
If we extend the domain so that x ∈핉, we get the
graph for y = 2 x – 1.
```
```
Look at the graph. For every x -value on this graph,
there is only one y -value. If a rule or a formula
produces only one y -value for each x -value, then
we have a function.
```
```
A function is a relationship between x and y , where for every x -value there
is only one y -value.
```
```
One way to decide whether or not a graph represents a function is to use
the vertical line test.
```
```
If any line drawn parallel to the y -axis cuts the graph only once, then the
graph represents a function.

## 4.2 Function notation

```
We use function notation f ( x ) to show that each y -value is a function of
an x -value.
```
```
We can also use other letters too, such as g ( x ), h ( x ), etc.
```
```
So y = 2 x – 1 can be written as f ( x ) = 2 x – 1.
```
```
The value of f ( x ) for any x -value can be worked out by substitution:
```
```
For example, at x = –3 we can find f (–3) = 2(–3) – 1 = –7
```
```
So the point (–3; –7) lies on the graph of f ( x ) = 2 x – 1
```
Activity 1

```

determine the value of h (–4). (3)
```
**2.** If the function _g_ ( _x_ ) = – _x_^2 –3 _x_ , find _g_ ( _x_ + _h_ ) (2)
**3.** If _f_ ( _x_ ) = 4 _x_ + 1, determine the value of:
**3.1** _f_ ( _x_ + _a_ )
**3.2** _f_ ( _x_ ) + _a_
**3.3** _af_ ( _x_ ) (3)
**4.** If _g_ ( _x_ ) = 2 _x_^2 , determine the value of:
**4.1** _g_ (– _x_ )
**4.2** – _g_ ( _x_ ) (2)
    **[10]**

```
Solutions
```
**1.** _h_ ( _x_ ) = (^) ( 1 __ 2 )
_x_
∴ _h_ (–4) = ( __  12 )
–4
3 ( 2  –1 ) –4 = 2^4 = 16 3
So when _x_ = –4, _y_ = 16 and the point (–4; 16) lies on the graph
of the function 3 _h_. (3)

**2.** _g_ ( _x_ ) = – _x_^2 – 3 _x_

```
∴ g ( x + h ) = –( x + h )^2 –3( x + h ) 3 wherever there is an x , replace it
with ( x + h )
= –( x^2 + 2 xh + h^2 ) – 3 x – 3 h
= – x^2 – 2 xh – h^2 – 3 x – 3 h 3
This means that when x = x + h , y = – x^2 – 2 xh – h^2 – 3 x – 3 h (2)
```
```
3.1 f ( x ) = 4 x + 1 3.2 f ( x ) = 4 x + 1 3.3 f ( x ) = 4 x + 1
f ( x + a ) = 4( x + a )+1 f ( x ) + a = 4 x + 1 + a af ( x ) = a (4 x + 1)
= 4 x + 4 a + 1 3 3 = 4 ax + a 3
(3)
```
```
4.1 g ( x ) = 2 x^2 4.2 g ( x ) = 2 x^2
g (– x ) = 2(– x )^2 – g ( x ) = –2 x^2  3
= 2 x^2   3 (2)
[10]
```
```
In each example, there is only
one possible y -value for each
x -value, so f ( x ); h ( x ) and g ( x )
are functions.

## 4.3 The basic functions, formulas and graphs

```
Important terms to remember:
```
```
domain: the set of possible x -values
```
```
Range: the set of possible y -values
```
```
Axis of symmetry: an imaginary line that divides a graph into two mirror
images of each other.
```
```
Maximum: the highest possible y -value of a function.
```
```
Minimum: the lowest possible y -value of a function.
```
```
Asymptote: an imaginary line that a graph approaches but never
touches.
```
```
turning point: The point at which a graph reaches its maximum or
minimum value and changes direction.
```
```
4.3.1 The linear function (straight line)
Linear functions have the form
f ( x ) = ax + q where a represents the
gradient of a straight-line graph and q
represents the y -intercept when x = 0.

Consider g ( x ) = ____ x – 2^8 –3 has the horizontal asymptote at y = –3 and
x – 2 ≠ 0 ∴ x ≠ 2 because if x = 2 the denominator of the expression ____ x^8 – 2
```
```
would be ____2 – 2^8 = 8 __ 0 which is undefined because the denominator
is zero.
```
```
Thus the graph is undefined for x – 2 = 0 ∴ x = 2 is the vertical asymptote

The graph y = __ x^8 shift 2 units to the right and 3 units down to form the

## 4.4 Inverse functions

- The inverse of a function takes the _y_ -values (range) of the function to
    the corresponding _x_ -values (domain) and vice versa. Therefore the _x_
    and _y_ values are interchanged.
- The function is reflected along the line _y_ = _x_ to form the inverse.
- The notation for the inverse of a function is _f_ –1.

```
**1.** Determine _f_ –1( _x_ )
**2.** Sketch the graphs of _f_ ( _x_ ), _f_ –1 ( _x_ ) and _y_ = _x_ on the same set of axis

```
Solutions
```
**1.** In order to find the inverse of a function, there are two steps:

```
STEP 1: Swap the x and y
y = 2 x + 6 3
becomes x = 2 y + 6 3
We then rewrite the equation to make y the subject of the formula.
Therefore,
```
```
STEP 2: make y the subject of the formula
x = 2 y + 6
x – 6 = 2 y 3
So y =^1 _ 2 x – 3 3
We can say that the inverse function f –1( x ) =^1 _ 2 x –3
```
```

•	 Every point on the function has the same coordinates as the corresponding
point on the inverse function, except that they are swapped around.
•	 Example: (–3; 0) on the function is reflected to become (0; –3) on the inverse
function.
•	 Any point ( a ; b ) on the function becomes the point ( b ; a ) on the inverse.
•	 To find the equation of an inverse function algebraically, we interchange x
and y and then solve for y.
•	 To draw the graph of the inverse function, we reflect the original graph
about the line
y = x , the axis of symmetry of the two graphs.

•	 This is not a function.
•	 Check it with a vertical line test.
There are two _y_ -values for one
_x_ -value.
•	 Not all inverses of functions are also
functions. Some inverses of functions
are relations.
•	 If an inverse is not a function, then
we can restrict the **domain** of the
**function** in order for the inverse to be
a function.
•	 To make the inverse a function, we need to choose a set of _x_ -values in the function and work
only with those. We call this **‘restricting the domain’**.
•	 A one to one function has an inverse that is a function
Example: _y_ = 3 _x_ + 4 is a one to one function. For every _x_ value there is one and only one _y_
value
The inverse of is a function.
•	 A many to one function has an inverse that is not a function. However, we can restrict the
domain of the function to make its inverse a function.
Example: _y_ = 2 _x_^2 is a many to one function. For two or many _x_ values there is one _y_ value.
(if _x_ = 2, then _y_ = 8.
If _x_ = –2, then _y_ = 8). Therefore, its inversey = ± (^) √
__
_x_ __ 2 , is not a function.
•	 To check for a function, draw a vertical line. If any vertical line cuts the graph in only one
place, the graph is a function.
If any vertical line cuts the graph in more than one place, then the graph is not a function.
•	 To check for a one-to-one function, draw a horizontal line. If any horizontal line cuts the
graph in only one place, the graph is a one-to-one function. If any horizontal line cuts the
graph in more than one place, then the graph is a many-to-one function. **[5]**

Sketch the graph of y = sin x for x
```
```
•	 We can make use of a table or a calculator to determine the critical points
on the graph.
•	 The endpoints of the domain must be included i.e.
x = −360° and x = 360°
•	 All intercepts with the x and y axis must be indicated as well as all minimum
and maximum points (turning points)

Conclusion
For graphs of the form y = sin ( x + p ), y = cos ( x + p ) and
y = tan ( x + p ),
p affects the horizontal shift of the graph.
•	 If p > 0 (positive), the graph moves p degrees to the left.
•	 If p < 0 (negative), the graph moves p degrees to the right.
•	 In all graphs the x -intercepts, y -intercepts, maximum and minimum
points must be indicated on the graph. If the value of b changes,
the x -intercepts, y -intercepts, maximum and minimum points also
change. In order to ensure that these points are always indicated, use
the following x -values for plotting the graph:

## 6.1 Revision: Simple and compound interest

Financial terms

- interest is a fee paid for the use of borrowed money, or money earned on
    money saved. It is calculated as a percentage of the money borrowed or lent.
- Simple interest is the interest on an initial (principal) sum of money. Each
    year you receive or you are charged the same amount of interest.

Simple interest of 6% p.a. (per year) on R100 means that if you borrow R100 for
a year, you owe that R100 and another R6 back. So you owe R106.

If you borrow R100 for 2 years, you will owe R100 + R6 + R6 = R112.

**Micro-lenders** and **Hire Purchase** agreements often work on simple interest at a
monthly or at a yearly interest rate.

Percentage increase or decrease in populations, number of learners etc., can also
be calculated using simple interest formula.

**•	 Compound interest** is also interest on a principal amount P. For each year,
the previous year’s final amount becomes the new principal amount. So the
interest is calculated on the principal and the interest from the previous
year.
Compound interest of 6% p.a. (per year) on R100 means that if you borrow
R100 for 2 years, you owe R100 + R6 = R106 in the first year.

In the second year, you owe R106 + 6% of R106.

R106 + (6% × R106) = R106 + R6,36 = R112,36

Here are the formulae for simple and compound interest.

```
Simple interest: A = P(1 + ni)
where P is the principal (original sum of money invested or borrowed)
i is the interest rate
n is the number of years
A is the final amount
```
```
In all calculations, round off
your final answer only.

If you borrow R300 at 9% p.a **simple interest** , how much will you owe after
7 years?
Solution
A =? P = R300 _i_ = 9% = ___ 1009 = 0,09 _n_ = 7 years
A = P(1 + _ni_ )
A = 300(1 + 7 × 0,09) = 489
After 9 years you will owe R489.
If you borrow R300 at 9% p.a **compound interest** , how much will you owe
after 7 years?
A =? P = 300 _i_ = 9% = ___ 1009 = 0,09 _n_ = 7 years
A = P(1 + i) _n_
A = 300(1 + 0,09)^7
A = 300(1,09)^7
A = 548,411736...
A ≈ R548,41 to the nearest cent.
Which is the better option?
R548,41 – R489 = R59,41
So compound interest is R59,41 more than simple interest after 7 years.

```
Compounded monthly means
the interest is calculated at
the end of every month. So
convert years to months.
```
```
11% per annum compounded monthly, so
we divide the interest rate by 12 months.

Solution
A = 214 000 P = 12 000 n = 10 i =?
A = P(1 + i ) n
214000 = 12000(1 + i )^10

Ms Gumede puts R3 500 into a savings account which pays 7,5% p.a.
compound interest. After some years, her account is worth R4 044,69.
```
```
For how long did she invest the money?
```
```
Solution
A = R4 044,69 P = R3 500 n =? i = 7,5% p.a. = 0,075
A = P(1 + i ) n
4 044,69 = 3 500(1 +0,075) n
4 044,69 = 3 500(1,075) n
4044,69
______ 3500 = (1,075) n
```
```
1,155625714 = (1,075) n
n = log1,075 1,155625714
n = 2,000008543
n = 2 years
So Ms Gumede invested the money for 2 years.

## 6.3 Simple and compound decay formulae

```
decay or depreciation is when a quantity decreases by a percentage of the
amount present. For example, your assets (house, car) and machinery lose
value through age and use.
```
```
Ways of calculating depreciation.
```
```
Simple decay or depreciation: a = P(1 – ni )

A car worth R120 000 depreciates at a rate of 12% (simple interest) p.a.
How much will the car be worth after 5 years?
```
```
Solution:
A = P(1 – ni ) A =? P = 120 000 i = 12% = 0,12 n = 5 years
A = 120 000 (1 – 5 × 0,12)
A = 48 000
The car will be worth R48 000 after 5 years.
```
```
Compound decay or depreciation: a = P(1 – i ) n
```
```
This is also called depreciation on a reducing balance because the interest
is calculated on the amount left over as it decreases. The amount left over
is ‘the reducing balance’.

A car worth R120 000 depreciates at a rate of 12% p.a. (on a reducing

```
```
How much will the car be worth after 5 years?
```
```
Solution
A = P (1 – i ) n A =? P = 120 000 i = 12% = 0,12 n = 5 years
A = 120 000 (1 – 0,12)^5
A = 63 327,83002...
A = R63 327,83 (to the nearest cent)
***Compare this with simple depreciation:
The car’s value is R63 327,83 – R48 000 = R15 327,83 less on simple decay
than on compound decay.

Thabo invested R 1 000 in a bank for 10 years. The interest rate was 6,5%
compounded quarterly for the first 3 years. For the next 5 years, the interest
was calculated at 7,2% compounded monthly and for the remainder of the
investment, the interest was at 7,8% compounded semi-annually.
```

## 6.6 Annuities

```
Annuities are number of equal payments made at regular intervals and
subject to a rate of interest.
```
```
Types of annuities are: Future value annuities and Present value annuities.
```
6.6.1 Using the Future Value formula

- You can save money by putting away the same amount of money
    every month for use in the future. This can be done through an
    annuity fund, a retirement fund, a savings account, or a sinking fund.
Compound interest is earned on your savings, so you will receive, at
    some time in the future, the total of all your monthly installments,
    as well as interest calculated every month on an increasing monthly
    balance.
Future value formula

```
When you pay equal monthly installments in order to save money for the
future, you can calculate using the future value formula.
```
```
F =
```
```
x [(1 + i ) n − 1]
__________ i
```
```
where F is the total accumulated at the end of the time period
x is the monthly installment
i is the interest rate per annum
n is the number of installments/payments
```
```
This formula is provided on the information sheet in the final exam.
```
```
NOTE: The formula assumes that payments start at the end of the first
month.

6.6.3 Using the Present Value formula

- You can borrow a large amount of money from the bank. This is
    called a loan. For example, there are student loans to pay for further
    studies, vehicle loans to buy a car and loans to buy a house.
- A bond or mortgage or a home loan is a loan used to buy a house or
    other property.
- The amount you must pay back is the total of the loan and the
    interest charged on it. You must pay back an equal amount each
    month called a monthly installment.

Each month, the interest is calculated on the amount you still owe.
Because you are paying back the same amount monthly, the amount
you owe is decreasing.
Here is a formula to work out your monthly installments. It is called
the Present Value Formula. It is _present_ because you receive the
money _now_ in the _present_. You start paying it back at the end of the
first month of the loan.

### P =

```
x [ 1 − (1 + i ) − n ) ]
____________ i
```
```
where P is the Present value
x is the monthly installment
i is the interest rate p.a.
n is the number of time periods to repay the loan
This formula is provided on the information sheet in the final exam.

**a)** How much will the tractor be worth in 5 years’ time if its
    value depreciates at 9% per annum on a reducing balance? (3)
**b)** After 5 years, the tractor needs to be replaced. During this
    time, inflation remains constant at 7% per annum. Determine
the cost of a new tractor after 5 years. (3)
**c)** He plans to sell this tractor at its book value and use the
money towards a new tractor. Calculate how much money
he will need to put into a Sinking Fund to buy a new
tractor in 5 years’ time. (1)
**d)** Calculate the value of the monthly payment into the sinking

**2.** Timothy buys furniture to the value of R10 000. He borrows the
    money on 1 February 2010 from a financial institution that charges
    interest at a rate of 9,5% p.a. compounded monthly. Timothy agrees
    to pay monthly installments of R450. The agreement of the loan
    allows Timothy to start paying these equal monthly installments
    from 1 August 2010.

    (becomes three times as big) if it is invested at 12% per annum
    compounded half-yearly. (5)

```
Solutions
```
**1. a)** Use compound depreciation with P = R450 000, _i_ = 0,09,
    _n_ = 5 years.
    A = P (1 – _i_ ) _n_
    A = 450 000 (1 – 0,09)^5  33
    A = 280 814,4653
    The tractor will be worth R 280 814,47 in 5 years’ time. 3
    (This is what its ‘book value’ or ‘scrap value’ will be in 5 years’

```
b) Use compound interest for inflation with P = R450 000, i = 0,07,
n = 5 years.
A = P(1 + i ) n
A = 450 000 (1 + 0,07)^5 33
A = 631 148.2788
A new tractor will cost R631 148,29 in 5 years’ time. 3 (3)

- The average gradient between two points on a curve is equal to
    the gradient of the straight line through the points. So the average
    gradient of curve AB is 12.
- As the two points are moved closer together, the average gradient
    approaches the gradient of the curve which is also the gradient of
    the tangent to the curve at that point. So the gradient of the curve
    AB at point B is 30.
- Remember that the tangent is a line that touches a curve at one
    point only.
- The average gradient tells us whether the graph is increasing or
    decreasing between those points.
- If the function is decreasing between two points, the average
    gradient will be negative.
- If the function is increasing between two points, the average gradient
    will be positive.

## 7.3 The derivative of a function at a point

```
The rate of change of a function at a point is called a derivative.
```
```
The derivative of a function at a point gives
```
- the rate of change of the function at the point
- the slope (gradient) of the tangent to the function at the point

```
Definition of a derivative
```
```
The derivative of a function y = f ( x ) is defined as f´ ( x ) = lim
h➞ 0
```
```
f ( x + h ) − f ( x )
_____________ h
```
```
This formula is provided on the information sheet in the final exam.
```
```
NOTE: The notation we use for the derivative of y = f ( x ) is
f´ ( x ) or y´ or
```
```
dy
___ dx or Dx [ f(x) ].
```
```
When we find the derivative of a function, we say we differentiate the
function.
```
```
7.3.1 The derivative from first principles
(Definition)
To differentiate from first principles (definition) use the formula below
```
```
f´ ( x ) = lim
h➞ 0
```
```
f ( x + h ) − f ( x )
__________ h

7.3.2 The rules of differentiation
You could find any derivative from first principles, but there are some quick
rules to find the derivative. Unless a question asks you to use the definition
or to ‘differentiate from first principles’, it is easier to use the rules.
```
```
You need to know and be able to use the following rules for differentiating:
```
```
Rules
```
**1.** If _f_ ( _x_ ) = _b_ then _f´_ ( _x_ ) = 0
where _b_ is a constant
**2.** If _f_ ( _x_ ) = _xn_ then _f´_ ( _x_ ) = _nxn_ –1
**3.** ___ _dxd_ [ _f_ ( _x_ ) ± _g_ ( _x_ )] = ___ _dxd_ [ _f_ ( _x_ )] ± ___ _dxd_ [ _g_ ( _x_ )]
**4.** ___ _dxd_ [ _kf_ ( _x_ )] = _k_ ___ _dxd_ [ _f_ ( _x_ )]

If k ( x ) = x^5 , then k´ ( x ) = 5 x^4
If f ( x ) = x^5 + x^4 , then ___ dxd f ( x ) = 5 x^4 + 4 x^3
If f ( x ) = 3 x^5 then

```
```
Before you use differentiation you might need to simplify or change the
format of the expressions:
```
**1. Expand brackets** e.g. expand (3 _x_ + 2)( _x_ – 5) to 3 _x_^2 – 13 _x_ – 10 because
    you have no rule for differentiating a product.
    So you need separate terms before you can differentiate.

## 7.4 Uses of the derivative

```
The derivative has many uses.
```
```
It can be used to:
```
- find the gradient of the equation of a tangent line
- identify stationary points on a graph
- find a maximum or minimum value
- describe rates of change
- draw graphs of cubic functions.
- (A cubic function has the form _f_ ( _x_ ) = _ax_^3 + _bx_^2 + _cx_ + _d_ )

```
7.4.1 Finding the equation of a tangent line
The slope of the tangent line to the graph at a point is equal to the derivative
of the function at that point. So, to find the equation of the tangent line to
f ( x ) at x = a , we must:
```
1. Find the derivative _f´_ ( _x_ )
2. Work out the derivative at _x_ = _a_ → i.e calculate _f´_ ( _a_ ) to get the
    gradient of the tangent line.
3. Calculate the _y_ value at _x_ = _a_ →i.e calculate _f_ ( _a_ ).
4. The tangent line is a straight line.
    We can find the equation of a straight line using _y_ – _y_ 1 = _m_ ( _x_ – _x_ 1 ) if
    we know the gradient _m_ and a point ( _x_ 1 ; _y_ 1 ) on the line.

Find the equation of the tangent to the function f ( x ) = x^3 + 2 x + 4 at the
point where x = 1.
```
```
Solution
f´ ( x ) = 3 x^2 + 2 1. Take the derivative
f´ ( 1 ) = 3(1)^2 + 2 = 5 2. Find the gradient of the tangent at x = 1 by
so m = 5 evaluating the derivative at x = 1.
f (1) = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 3. Calculate the y -value at x = 1
Tangent line: y – 7 = 5( x – 1) 4. Use y – y 1 = m ( x – x 1 ) to give the equation of the
tangent line
y – 7 = 5 x – 5
y = 5 x + 2
So the equation of the tangent at x = 1 is y = 5 x + 2

## 7.5 Drawing the graph of a cubic polynomial

```
A cubic polynomial is a function of the form f ( x ) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d and we
can represent it with a graph. In order to draw the graph, we need to work
out the characteristics of the graph.
```
- We can use the derivative to identify the slope of the graph at certain
    points.
- We also need to know how to solve equations in the third degree, so
    that we can work out the _x_ - and _y_ -intercepts of the graph.

```

Work through this example:
Factorise and solve for x : x^3 – x^2 – 5 x = 3
```
```
Solutions
```
**1.** Get _ax_^3 + _bx_^2 + _cx_ + _d_ = 0 i.e. _x_^3 – _x_^2 – 5 _x_ – 3 = 0 (Standard form)
**2.** Use the **Factor and Remainder** theorem to find one factor.
    Use trial and error.
    _This step can also be calculated on a calculator – see below._

```
The factor theorem states:
If f(k) = 0, then x – k is a factor of f(k)
```
```
So if f ( x ) = x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3, we want to find an x -value that makes f ( x ) = 0.
f ( x ) has a constant value of –3.
If this expression can be factorised, then at least one of its factors will use a factor of –3 in it.
The factors of –3 are –3; –1; 1; 3
By trial and error, test these factors to find which value of x gives f ( x ) = 0.
f ( x ) = x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3
If x = –3, then f (–3) = –27 – 9 + 15 – 3 = –24 ≠ 0
If x = –1, then f (–1) = –1 –1 + 5 – 3 = 0
∴ x –(–1) is a factor of f ( x )
∴ x + 1 is a factor of x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3.
We will use x + 1 to find the other factors.
```
**3.** Divide _x_ 3 – _x_ 2 – 5 _x_ – 3 by _x_ + 1 to find the other factors.
    You can use the algebraic method, long division or synthetic division at this point.

```
Method I: Using algebra
x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3 = ( x + 1)( x^2 + px – 3)
Check this: First terms give x^3 , last terms give –3.
We don’t know the middle terms, so we have used px in the second bracket.
```

```
© Department of Basic Education 2015 uNiT 7 CALCuLuS 133
```
**7** Unit Unit **7**

```
To calculate the value of p :
The x^2 term in the expression has a coefficient of –1
So the x^2 part of the factorised expression must make – x^2
x ( px ) + 1( x^2 ) = px^2 + x^2
∴ px^2 + x^2 = – x^2
px^2 = – 2 x^2
∴ p = –2
∴ x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3 = ( x + 1)( x^2 –2 x – 3)
```
```
Method II: Long division [Divide, Multiply, Subtract, Bring down]
```
```
x^2 – 2 x – 3
```
```
x + 1 x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3 divide: x^3 ÷ x
answer x^2 on top
x^3 + x^2 multiply: x^2 ( x + 1)
–2 x^2 – 5 x subtract & bring down
divide: –2 x^2 ÷ x
answer –2 x on top
–2 x^2 – 2 x multiply: –2 x ( x + 1)
```
- 3 _x_ – 3 subtract & bring down
- 3 _x_ – 3 divide: –3 _x_ ÷ _x_
    answer –3 on top
    multiply: –3( _x_ + 1)
0 subtract

```
∴ x^3 – x^2 – 5 x – 3 = ( x + 1)( x^2 –2 x – 3) = ( x +1)( x – 3)( x +1)
```
```

_x_^3 – _x_^2 – 5 _x_ – 3 = ( _x_ + 1)( _x_^2 –2 _x_ – 3) = ( _x_ + 1)( _x_ –3)( _x_ + 1)
**5.** Determine the three solutions.
If ( _x_ + 1)( _x_ –3)( _x_ + 1) = 0,
Then ( _x_ + 1) = 0 or ( _x_ –3) = 0 or ( _x_ + 1) = 0
_x_ = –1 or _x_ = 3 or _x_ = –1
These are the _x_ -intercepts of a cubic graph with the equation: _f_ ( _x_ ) = _x_ 3 – _x_ 2 – 5 _x_ – 3

7.5.2 Stationary points of a cubic function

- Stationary points on a graph are points where the gradient of the
    graph is 0. This is at points where the direction of the curve of the
    graph changes.
On a cubic function, the stationary points are at local maximum or
    minimum turning point. There are also situations where a point of
    inflection can also be a stationery point as indicated on figure 2 of
    the example below.
NOte: A point of inflection is not always a stationary point.

The derivative f´ ( x ) gives us the slope of a graph.
```
```
So to find the coordinates of the turning points of a function f ( x ), we
solve f´ ( x ) = 0.
```
```
To find the coordinates of the point of inflection, find the derivative of the
derivative , f´´ ( x ). This is called the second derivative. Solve for f´´ ( x ) = 0.

7.5.3 Drawing the graph of a cubic function
To draw a graph of a cubic function, follow these steps:
```
1. Find the **y** -intercept by finding _f_ (0). When
    _x_ = 0, what is the value of _y_?
2. Find the **x** -intercepts by finding _x_ value(s)
    where _f_ ( _x_ ) = 0. Factorise _f_ ( _x_ ) to be able
    to work out these values.
Identify one factor using the factor theorem.
The factor theorem: If _f_ ( _k_ ) = 0, then _x_ – _k_ is a factor of _f_ ( _x_ ).
3. Find the stationary points or turning point by solving _f´_ ( _x_ ) = 0.

```
NB: The three steps indicated above are very important. Sketch
graph should have all the above points with correct identification of
the shape explained below.
```
4. Identify the end behavior i.e. identify what happens to the graph for
    very large positive and negative values of _x_.
    - If _a_ > 0, then _f_ ( _x_ ) is
       positive for very big values
       of _x_ and negative for very
       big negative values of _x_.
    - If _a_ < 0, then _f_ ( _x_ ) is
       negative for very big
       values of _x_ and positive
       for very big negative
       values of _x_.

Sketch the graph of f ( x ) = x^3 – 4 x^2 – 11 x + 30.
```
**1. y-intercept:** When _x_ = 0, _f_ (0) = 30 so _y_ -intercept is at (0; 30).
**2. x-intercepts:** Test some values of _x_ (choose factors of 30)
_f_ (1) = 16 so ( _x_ – 1) is not a factor. _f_ (–1) = 36 so ( _x_ + 1) is not
    a factor.
_f_ (2) = 0 so ( _x_ – 2) is a factor.

```
```
∴ x^3 – 4 x^2 – 11 x + 30 = ( x – 2)( x – 5)( x + 3) Factorise the trinomial
```
```
So when y = 0, ( x – 2) = 0 or ( x – 5) = 0 or ( x + 3) = 0
```
```
∴ x = 2, x = 5 or x = –3.
```

```
```
Solutions
```
**1. a)** When _x_ = 0, _y_ = 10, therefore are (0; 10) 3 (1)

```
b) Assuming that (2; 0) is the x -intercept, then x –2 is a factor of f ( x )
f ( x ) = − x^3 − x^2 + x + 10 = ( x − 2)( − x^2 − 3 x − 5) 33
∴ x − 2 = 0 or − x^2 − 3 x − = 0 3
x = 2 but − x^2 − 3 x − 5 = 0 has no real solution. Hence ( x – 2) is
the only x -intercept 33 (5)
```
```
c) At the turning point f´ ( x ) = − 3 x^2 − 2 x + 1 = 0 3
(–3 x + 1)( x +1) = 0
x =^1 _ 3 or x = – 1 33
When x = __^13 , y = − __ 271 − 1 __ 9 + __^13 + 10 = 270 − 3 + 9 − 1____________ 27 = 275 ___ 27 = 10 __ 275
```
Therefore turning point is (^) ( 1 __ 3 ; 275 ___ 27 ) = (^) ( 1 __ 3 ; 10 __ 275 ) 3
When _x_ = –1, _y_ = 1 – 1 – 1 +10 = 9
Therefore turning point is − (1; 9) 3 (5)

∴ at x = − __^26 = − __^13     3 (2)
```
**2. a)** Since A and B are the _x_ -intercepts of _g_ they are solutions of
    –(2 _x_ – 5)( _x_ + 2)^2 = 0 3
    i.e. _x_ = –2 and _x_ = __^52 The distance between –2 and
    5 __ 2 is __^52 – (–2) = 4,5 units 3 (2)

```
b) T is a turning point. g´ ( x ) = –6 x^2 –6 x + 12 = 0. 3
–6( x^2 + x – 2) = 0
–6( x + 2)( x – 1) = 0
When x = –2 or x = 1. 33
So the x -coordinate of T is 1. (3)
```

```
**7** Unit Unit **7**

```
c) g´ (3) = –6(–3)^2 –6(–3) + 12 = –24 3
So the equation of the tangent line is y – 11 = –24( x + 3) 3
which simplifies to y = –24 x – 61 3 (3)
```
```
d) The graph of y = k is shown together with g ( x ) below.
Using these graphs we can observe that, provided the line lies above
the y -value of A and below that of T, the equation
–2 x^3 – 3 x^2 + 12 x + 20 = k will have 3 distinct roots.
At T, g (1) = –2 – 3 + 12 + 20 = 27. So for 0 < k < 27 the equation
has 3 distinct roots. 3333 (4)

**1.** Find an equation for what you want to minimise:
Surface area of glass = area of base + area of curved surface
So S = π _r_^2 + 2π _rh_ 3
Because you cannot take the derivative if there are two different variables in the
    equation ( _r_ and _h_ ), you must use other information to help you get the equation
    for what you want to minimise in terms of one variable only.
We know the glass holds 200 ml = 200 cm^3.
    The volume of the glass is π _r_^2 h
    So π _r_^2 _h_ = 200 so _h_ = 200 ___π _r_ 2 3

And so we can say
```
S = π _r_^2 + 2π _r_ (^) ( ___ (^200) π _r_ 2 ) = π _r_^2 + 400 ___ _r_ 3
Now the only variable is _r_ , because π is a constant.
Write S in a way that is easy to find the derivative:
S = π _r_^2 + 400 _r_ −1
Take the derivative of the function you want to minimise:
S _´_ = 2π _r_ − 400 _r_ −2 3
Put the derivative equal to 0:
2π _r_ − 400 _r_ −2 = 0
2π _r_ = 400 _r_ −2
2π _r_^3 = 400 _r_ ≠ 0
_r_^3 = 400 ___2π 3

Probability

## 8.1 Revision

```
Probability is the study of how likely it is that an event will happen. The following
questions are typical probability questions:
```
- What is the chance that it will rain tomorrow?
- If I buy a Lotto ticket, what is the chance that I will win the Lotto?

```
We can use a probability scale to decide what chance there is of an event
happening.
```
### 0 1 __ 4 1 __ 2 3 __ 4 1

```
Impossible Poor chance; Fair chance Good chance Certain;
0% unlikely, but very likely; definite
possible; 75% 100%
25%
```
```
•	 We can work out the probability using the formula:
Probability = ____________________number of favourable outcomesnumber of possible outcomes
•	 This ratio can be expressed as a common fraction, a decimal fraction or a percentage.
So a probability of 5 out of 8 can be written as^5 _ 8 or as 0,625 or as 62,5%.
•	 Probability always lies between 0 and 1, measured as a fraction or as a decimal.
If probability is shown as a percentage, then it lies between 0% and 100%.

## 8.2 Theoretical probability and relative frequency

```
If you flip a coin:
```
- The possible outcomes are H (heads) or
    T (tails).
- There are two possible outcomes. Each has a
    50% chance of happening.
- We say that there is a theoretical probability
    of __^12 for each outcome.

```
The theoretical probability of getting the outcome
heads (H), is written as P(H).
```
```
P(H) = __^12
```
```
Relative frequency
```
```
Try this experiment:
```
- Flip a coin 10 times. Did it land on heads exactly 5 out of 10 times?

•	 Mantse flipped a coin 10 times and it landed on heads 7 times. So for
her experiment, the relative frequency of heads is __ 107.
•	 Jake flips a coin 100 times and records his results. His record shows
that he flipped heads 55 times. So the relative frequency of heads
is ___ 10055. Therefore, the relative frequency of tails is ___ 10045.
•	 Jake flips the coin 1 000 times. Now it is likely that heads and tails
will come up about the same number of times. He is likely to get
heads 499 to 501 times.
Now the relative frequency is equal to or close to the theoretical
probability of 1 __ 2.
```
```
Relative frequency is called
Empirical probability or
Experimental probability
Although the theoretical
probability of getting heads
is ½, your experiment
often does not show this
exactly. The results of your
experiment give you the
relative frequency of getting
heads in that particular
experiment.

## 8.3 Venn diagrams

```
We use Venn diagrams to help us to represent different events. Venn
Diagram consists of circles and a rectangle
```
```
The rectangle S represents the sample space (all of the possible outcomes).
Each circle inside S represents a different event.
```
```
If the two circles intersect, the intersection shows which outcomes belong
to both events.

**1.** Draw a Venn diagram to show the sample space
    S = {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10}
Indicate the following events in the sample space:
Event A is the set of prime numbers.
∴A = {2; 3; 5; 7}
Event B is the set of even numbers.
∴B = {2; 4; 6; 8; 10}

```
Solution
```
```

```
### A B

### 3 8

### 2 6

### 5 4

### 7 10

### 1 9

```
•	 Both sets have 2 in them,
so A and B must intersect.
•	 Write in 2 first in the
intersection.
•	 Then write in the
remaining numbers in
each event.
•	 Check if there are any
numbers that are not in
Event A or Event B.
•	 1 and 9 is part of the
sample space, but not in
A or in B. Write it in the
rectangle, but not in A
or B.

## 8.4 Mutually exclusive events

```
Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
There is no intersection between the events.
```
- Mutual: applies to two or more people or events.
- exclude: to keep out, not allow a person in.
- Mutually exclusive: Both events keep the other out. So there is no
    outcome that can happen in both events at the same time.

If you roll a die, it is impossible for it to land on a 1 and a 6 at the same
time. So P(1) and P(6) are mutually exclusive.
When you roll a die, what are the chances of getting a 6 or a 1?
So P(1 or 6) = P(1) + P(6) = 1 __ 6 + __^16 = 2 __ 6 = __^13
So the chance of rolling either a 1 or a 6 is 1 __ 3 or 33,3%
```
```
S: Possible outcomes
for rolling a die
```
```
Roll a 5
```
```
Roll a 1 Roll a 6
```
```
Roll a 4
```
```
Roll a 2 Roll a 3
```
```
When two events are mutually exclusive, P(A and B) = 0
```
```
∴ P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) for mutually exclusive events
```
```
We can also use this rule for the number of elements or outcomes in each
event, if the events are mutually exclusive:
```
```
n(A or B) = n(A) + n(B)
```
```
When the two events are mutually exclusive, then they do not overlap.
Therefore the intersection of A and B is empty and we write A∩B = ∅
(empty set) and P(A∪B) = 0
```
```
If P(A and B)
= 0 or if P(A or B) = P(A)
+ P(B), then the events are
mutually exclusive

## 8.5 Complementary events

```
Events that are mutually exclusive and make up the whole sample
space are called complementary events. There is no intersection and no
elements from the sample set are outside the two sets.
```
```
The possible events when you roll a die are 1; 2; 3; 4; 5 or 6.
```
```
The probability of rolling a 4 is^1 __ 6.
```
```
The probability of not rolling a 4 is __^56.
```
```
So the event not rolling a 4 is
the complement of the event
rolling a 4.
```
```
So P(4) + P(4 ´ ) =^1 __ 6 + 5 __ 6 = 1
```
```
The complementary rule:
P(A ´ ) + P(A) = 1 or P(A ´ ) = 1 – P(A)
P(A ´ ) means probability of ‘not A’.
```
```
In the example, n(not rolling a 4) + n(rolling a 4) = 5 + 1 = 6
```

The sample space S = {1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12}
In the sample space, event A is the set of multiples of 3.
So Set A = {3; 6; 9; 12}
Event B is the set of odd numbers.
So B = {1; 3; 5; 7; 9; 11}
```
```
P(A) = favourable outcomes________________possible outcomes = __ 124 = __^13
```
```
P(B) = __ 126 = 1 __ 2
```
```
So P(A) + P(B) = __ 124 + __ 126 = 10 __ 12
```
```
P(A or B) is the chance of getting the numbers in set A or in set B.
We cannot count the 3 and the 9 for both sets. We cannot repeat the
numbers in the intersection of set A and set B.
So P(A or B) = __ 128.
So P(A) + P(B) ≠ P(A or B)
To make them equal, we need to subtract the probability of the intersection,
P(A ∩ B)
P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B) = __ 124 + __ 126 – __ 122 = __ 128 This is the answer we found
for P(A or B).
```
```
The ADDITION rule for the probability of ANY two events in a sample
space:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A ∩ B)
```
```
We can also use this rule for the number of elements or outcomes in each
set:
n(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) – n(A ∩ B)

## 8.7 Summary of symbols and sets used in probability

```
There are some symbols you need to use when describing probability. We
have used some of them already.
```
```
To explain the use of each symbol, we will use these sets again:
```
```
S = {a; b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i} and A = {a; e; i}, B = {a; b; c; d; f; g;}, where S=
Sample Space, A and B are two sets is the sample space
```
```
P(A) (A) means the probability that an element from set A will occur.
```
```
P(A) =^3 __ 9 = __^13
```
```
n(A) n(A) means the number of elements in set A.
```
```
n(A) = 3
```
```
A ´ A ´ means all the elements of the sample space that are NOT in
set A. This is the complement of set A.
```
```
A ´ = {b; c; d; f; g; h}
```
```
∪ A ∪ B means the same as A OR B.
```
```
It means the union of the two sets and represents the total
of all the elements that are in set A or set B. No elements are
repeated.
```
```
A ∪ B = {a; b; c; d; e; f; g; i}
```
```
∩ A ∩ B is the same as A and B.
```
```
It means the intersection of sets A and B and represents all the
elements that they share. (All the elements that are in both set
A and set B at the same time). This is where the sets overlap.
```
```
A ∩ B = {a}
```
```
P(A ∩ B) P(A ∩ B) means the probability that an element from (A ∩ B)
will occur. P(A ∩ B) =^1 __ 9
```
```
P(A ∪ B) P(A ∪ B) means the probability that an element from (A ∪ B)
will occur. P(A ∪ B) =^8 __ 9
```
```
n(A ∪ B) n(A ∪ B) means the number of elements in set A or set B.
n(A ∪ B) = 8
```
```
n(A ∩ B) n(A ∩ B) means the number of elements in set A and set B at
the same time (the elements they share). n(A ∩ B) = 1
```
```
(A ∩ B) ´ (A ∩ B) ´ means all the elements of the sample space that are
NOT in (A ∩ B), the complement of A ∩ B.
```
```
(A ∩ B) ´ = {b; c; d; e; f; g; h; i}
```
```
(A ∪ B) ´ (A ∪ B) ´ means all the elements of the sample space that are
NOT in (A ∪ B).

A survey is conducted with a group of 50 learners to find out what is more
popular at the school tuckshop. They are asked if they usually buy toasted
sandwiches (T), salads (S) or burgers (B).
```
```
They can choose none, one, two or three of the meals.
```
```
The survey results are shown with this Venn diagram:
```
### T

### S

### B

### 15

### 2 10

### 1 3 5

### 4

```
a) How many people did not buy salads, toasted sandwiches or
burgers?
b) Calculate the probability that a learner selected at random from this
survey:
i) buys salad, but not toasted sandwiches or burgers.
ii) buys toasted sandwiches and salad, but not burgers.
iii) buys salad or burgers or both, but not toasted sandwiches.
```
```
Solutions:
a) 50 – (15 + 2 + 10 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 4) = 50 – 40 = 10

A school organised a camp for 103 Grade 12 learners. The learners were
asked which food they prefer for the camp.
```
```
They had to choose from chicken (C), vegetables (V) and fish (F).
```
```
The following information was collected:
```
```
•	 2 learners do not eat chicken, fish or vegetables
•	 5 learners eat only vegetables
•	 2 learners only eat chicken
•	 21 learners do not eat fish
•	 3 learners eat only fish
•	 66 learners eat chicken and fish
•	 75 learners eat vegetables and fish
```
```
Let the number of learners who eat chicken, vegetables and fish be x.
a) Draw a Venn diagram to represent the information. (6)
b) Calculate x. (3)
c) Calculate the probability that a learner, chosen at random:
i) Eats only chicken and fish, and no vegetables. (2)
ii) Eats any TWO of the given food choices:
chicken, vegetables and fish. (2)
[13]
```
```
Solutions:
a) Fill in any given information that
you can.
We do not know where these
belong yet:
```
- 21 learners do not eat fish
- 66 learners eat chicken and fish
So let _x_ be learners who eat
    chicken, fish and vegetables.
Then 66 – _x_ is learners who eat
    only chicken and fish.
Introduce _y_ , the learners who do
    not eat fish, but do eat chicken
    and vegetables.
Then 2 + _y_ + 5 + 2 = 21
∴ _y_ = 12 333333 (6)
**b)** 2 + 12 + 5 + 66 – _x_ + _x_ + 3 + 75 – _x_ + 2 = 103 33
- _x_ + 165 = 103
    - _x_ = –62
    _x_ = 62 3 (3)
**c) (i)** ____66– 103 _x_ = ___ 1034 33 (2)

The probability of flipping a coin and it lands on heads is P(H) = 1 __ 2.
```
```
What is the probability of flipping two coins and they both land on heads?
```
```
Solution
There are four possible outcomes:
H and H; H and T; T and H; T and T.
So H and H is 1 out of 4 outcomes and P(H and H) = __^14.
```
```
A tree diagram is a picture that helps you to list all possible outcomes of
the events.
```
```
Here is the tree diagram for P(H and H) if you flip a coin twice:
```
### 1 __ 2

### 1 __ 2

### __^12

### __^12

### 1 __ 2

### 1 __ 2

### H

### H

### H

### T

### T

### T

### HT

### TH

### T T

### H H

```
1 st flip 2 nd flip outcomes
```
```
The tree diagram shows 4 outcomes.
```
```
Each time you flip the coin, the outcomes (heads or tails) do not depend
on the outcomes of the last flip. So these events are independent of each
other.

You have a pack of cards (no jokers).
```
```
What is the probability of these two
events?
```
- Event A: Drawing a heart
    card from a pack of cards and
    _putting it back_.
- Event B: Drawing a heart card
    from the pack again.
A and B are independent events. No
matter what card is drawn in Event
A, it is put back in the pack. So the
outcome of event B does not depend
on the outcome of event A.

```
tree diagram
```
```
Here is the tree diagram for all possible outcomes of the two events.
```
```
P(A and B) = __ 161
Compare this with:
P(A) × P(B) = – __^14 – __^14 = __ 161
∴ P(A and B) = P(A) × P (B)

Events are independent if the probability of one event happening is not influenced
by another event happening. P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)........if the events are
independant

2. dependent events
Two successive events are dependent if the outcomes of the one
    event influence the outcomes of the other event.

```
There are 52 cards in a pack (or deck).
There are 4 suits:
hearts; spades; diamonds and clubs.
To draw a card, means to take a

What is the probability of these two events?
```
- Event A: Drawing a heart from a regular pack of cards and not
    putting it back.
- Event B: Drawing a heart again, from the rest of the pack
    (51 cards left).

```
Solution
A and B are dependent events, because event B depends on the outcomes
of event A.
Here is a tree diagram for Event A and Event B.
```
```
P(A and B) = __ 171
Compare this with:
P(A) × P(B) = __^14 × 1 __ 4 = __ 161
∴ P(A and B) ≠ P(A) × P (B)
When the events are dependent.

## 8.9 Contingency tables

```
We can also use a contingency table to represent all possible outcomes
of events.
```
```
Look at the same example we used for the tree diagram above:
What is the probability of these two events?
```
- Event A: Drawing a heart card from a pack of cards and putting it
    back.
- Event B: Drawing a heart card from the pack again.

```
We can make a table of possible outcomes using columns for the type of
card drawn and rows for the events:
```
```
Numbers in each
row add up to totals
on the right.
Numbers in each
column add up
to totals below the
table.

2) will have blond hair
3) will have black hair or brown hair
4) will have blond hair or brown hair or black hair
```
```
Solutions
1) 17 learners have brown hair out of a total of 50 ∴ P (brown hair) = __^1750
```
```
2) 11 learners have blond hair out of a total of 50 ∴ P (blond hair) = __^1150
3) 22+17=39 learners have black or brown hair out of a total of 50
∴ P (black or brown hair) = 39 __ 50
4) 22+17+11=50 learners have black or brown or blond hair out of a
total of 50
∴ P (black or brown or blond hair) = 50 __ 50 = 1

**1.** P(A) = 0,45; P(B) = 0,3 and P(A or B) = 0,165.
Are the events A and B:
**a)** mutually exclusive
**b)** independent (7)
**2.** What is the probability of throwing at least one six in four rolls of a
    regular die? (3)
**3.** What is the probability of throwing four 6s in a row with four rolls
    of a regular die? (3)
**4.** If two dice are rolled at the same time, what is the probability that
    the sum of the two numbers is 9? (3)
       **[16]**

```
Solutions
```
**1. a)** P(A or B) = P(A) + P (B) – P(A and B)
    Events A and B are mutually exclusive if P(A and B) = 0
    ∴ _if events are mutually exclusive, then_ P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
    P(A or B) = 0,165
    P(A) + P(B) = 0,45 + 0,3 = 0,75 33
    ∴ P(A or B) ≠ P(A) + P(B) 3 (3)
    Events A and B are _not_ mutually exclusive.
    **b)** Events A and B are independent if P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)
    To work out P(A and B), use the rule for P(A or B):
    **P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A and B)** for all events A and B
    0,165 = 0,45 + 0,3 – P(A and B) 33
    ∴ P(A and B) = 0,75 – 0,165 = 0,585 3
    But P(A) = 0,45 and P(B) = 0,3 ∴ P(A) × P(B) = 0,45 × 0,3 = 0,135 3
    ∴ P(A and B) ≠ P(A) × P(B)
    ∴ Events A and B are _not_ independent. (4)
**2.** The probability of not throwing a six in 4 rolls of a die is:

P(6) = (^) ( __ (^56) )
4
= ____ 1296625
∴ _P(at least one 6)_ = 1 − ____ 1296625 = ____ 1296671 333 (3)

**3.** Each roll of the die is independent of the previous one.
P(four 6s in a row) = __^16 × __^16 × 1 __ 6 × __^16 = _____1 296^1     333 (3)

```
```
How many word arrangements can be made with the word MOM if the repeated
letters are treated as the same letters.
```
```
Solutions
```
**1.** There are three letters. Let us write the first M as M 1 and the second M and M 2
    M 1 OM 2 M 1 M 2 O OM 1 M 2 OM 2 M 1 M 2 OM 1 M 2 M 1 O
    ∴3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
**2.** If we remove the 1 and the 2 from the letter M, we will obtain the following words:
    MOM MMO OMM
Therefore, there are only three possible words from the word MOM
3 = __3!2!. The 3! (the numerator) indicates the total number of words formed with
three letters and the 2! (the denominator) indicates the number of times a letter is
    repeated.

There are 6 people in a room. Call them A, B, C, D, E and F.
How many different groups of 2 people are possible?
```
```
Solution
The question is really – how many permutations of 2 people (A to F) are
possible?
We can list them:
AB AC AD AE AF (5) or BA CA DA EA FA (5)
BC BD BE BF (4) or CB DB EB FB (4)
CD CE CF (3) or DC EC FC (3)
DE DF (2) or EC FD (2)
EF (1) or FE (1)
There are 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 30 different groups of 2
people.
```
```
To find this answer without writing all the possibilities out, we can use the
formula:
```
Permutations: _m_ P _n_ = _____( _mm_ –! _n_ (^) )!
where _m_ = total number of possibilities
_n_ = number of items chosen in a group
So^6 P 2 = _____(6–2)!6! = 6!__4! = 6×5×4×3×2×1___________4×3×2×1 = 6 × 5 = 30
_Use the factorial key on the calculator, or work it out as shown here._
d) the number of permutations of _m_ items taken _n_ at a time (where
the items may be repeated any number of times)

SUMMARY
the basic counting principle:
```
```
The number of ways of making several decisions in succession (call them
m 1 ; m 2 and m 3 etc...) is determined by multiplying the numbers of choices
that can be made in each decision. m 1 × m 2 × m 3 ...
```
```
Permutations
```
- The number of permutations of _m_ different items is **m**!
- The number of permutations of _m_ items of which:

_a_ are alike, _b_ are alike, _c_ are alike is: ________ _a_! × _mb_!! (^) × _c_!

- The number of permutations of _m_ items taken _n_ at a time, when each
    of the items may be repeated any number of times, is:
**m** × **m** × **m** × **m** × ... to **n** factors = **mn** times.
- The number of ways that _m_ items taken _n_ at a time can be arranged,

is **mPn** = _____( **mm** –! **n** (^) )!

## 9.2 The equation of a line

You can find the equation of a straight line using _y_ = _m x_ + _c_ , if you know
the gradient _m_ and the _y_ -intercept _c_.

You can also find the equation of a straight line using _y_ − _y_ 1 = _m_ ( _x_ − _x_ 1 ), if
you know the gradient _m_ and any point ( _x_ 1 ; _y_ 1 ) on the line, or if two points
given.

NOTE: _y_ 1 and _x_ 1 are the coordinates of a specific point on the line.

If the gradient of a line is –2 and the point (4; –1) lies on the line, find the
equation of the line. _y_ − _y_ 1 = m ( _x_ − _x_ 1 )

_y_ – (–1) = –2( _x_ – 4) substitute (4; –1) into the equation

_y_ + 1 = –2 _x_ + 8 simplify

_y_ = –2 _x_ +7 We usually put the answer in the form _y_ = _mx_ + _c_.

**2.** Line AB is perpendicular to CD, which has a gradient of –2. The
    point (3; 4) lies on AB. Determine the equation of line AB. (2)
       **[5]**

```
Solutions
```
**1.** First calculate the gradient of PQ:
_m_ =
    _____ _y_^2 − _y_^1
       _x_ 2 − _x_ 1 =^ ____8 − 23 − 1^ =^6 __ 2 = 3^3
Then use the form _y_ − _y_ 1 = _m_ ( _x_ − _x_ 1 )
_y_ − _y_ 1 = 3( _x_ − _x_ 1 ) 3
Substituting P(1; 2)
_y_ − 2 = 3 ( _x_ − 1)
_y_ − 2 = 3 _x_ − 3
∴ The equation of linePQ is _y_ = 3 _x_ − 1. 3 (3)
**2.** _m_ CD = –2 and CD ⊥AB.
∴ _m_ AB = 1 __ 2
So now we have _y_ = 1 __ 2 _x_ + _c_
Substitute (3; 4) to find the value of _c_.
4 = __^12 (3) + _c_ 3
_c_ = 4 – 1 1 __ 2

```
∴ c = 2 1 __ 2
∴ equation of line AB is y = 1 __ 2 x + 2 __^12     3 (2)

## 9.3 The inclination of a line

In trigonometry, you used the ratios tan θ, sin θ and cosθ.

To find the inclination of a line, or the angle it makes with the _x_ -axis, we
use tan θ.

In triangle ABC, tan θ =

```
opp
___adj = BC___AC.
```
BC___AC is also

```
change in y
_________change in x which is the gradient of AB.
```
We write gradient of AB as _m_ AB.

So we can say _m_ AB = tan θ

Angle θ shows the slope or inclination of the line AB.

θ is called the angle of inclination.

NOte: θ ∈ (0^0 ;180^0 )

The equation of a circle is ( _x_ + 1)^2 + ( _y_ – 3)^2 = 16.

Determine the coordinates of the centre and the length of the radius.

The equation is already in the form ( _x_ – _a_ )^2 + ( _y_ – _b_ )^2 = _r_^2 ,
with _a_ = –1, _b_ = 3 and _r_^2 = 16

So the centre is (–1; 3) and the radius is (^) √
___
16 = 4.
Remember that the radius can only be a positive number because it is a
length.
Activity 7

**1.** Determine the coordinates of the centre and the length of the
    radius if a circle has the equation: _x_^2 – 2 _x_ + _y_^2 + 10 _y_ = –14 (3)
**2.** Determine the equation of a circle with centre C(–1; –2) and
    passing through the point B(1; –6). (3)
       **[6]**

```
Solutions
```
**1.** To get the equation in the form ( _x_ – _a_ )^2 + ( _y_ – _b_ )^2 = _r_^2 , we need to add in
    numbers to complete the squares using _x_^2 with –2 _x_ and _y_^2 with 10 _y_.
( _x_^2 – 2 _x_ ) + ( _y_^2 + 10 _y_ ) = –14
( _x_^2 – 2 _x_ + 1) + ( _y_^2 + 10 _y_ + 25) = –14 + 1 + 25 3
( _x_ – 1)^2 + ( _y_ + 5)^2 = 12 3
So the centre is the point (1; –5) and the radius is √

```
___
12 = √
```
```
____
22 .3 = 2 √
```
```
__
3 3 (3)
```
**2.** First find the value of _r_^2 :
_r_^2 = ( _x_ – _a_ )^2 + ( _y_ – _b_ )^2
_r_^2 = ( _x_ + 1)^2 + ( _y_ + 2)^2 3
Substitute B(1; –6)
_r_^2 = (1+ 1)^2 + (–6 + 2)^2 3
_r_^2 = (2)^2 + (–4)^2
_r_^2 = 4 + 16 =20
∴20 = ( _x_ + 1)^2 + ( _y_ + 2)^2 3 (3)

9.4.2 The equation of a tangent to a circle
A tangent is a straight line which touches a
circle at one point only.
```
```
So ADB is a tangent, but AP is not a tangent.
```
```
A tangent to a circle at any point on the
circumference is perpendicular to the radius
at that point. So AB ⊥ CD.
```
```
We can use all the formulae we know from
analytical geometry to solve problems involving a tangent to a circle
(distance, midpoint, gradient, angle of inclination, the equation of a line
and the equation of a circle).

Trigonometry

## 10.1 Revise: Trig ratios

Trigonometry is the study of the relationship between the sides and angles of
triangles.

The word trigonometry means ‘measurement of triangles’.

the trigonometric ratios

Using θ as the reference angle in ΔABO

- The side opposite the 90° is the hypotenuse side, therefore
    side AO is the hypotenuse side.
- The side opposite θ is the opposite side, therefore AB is the
    opposite side.
- The side adjacent to θ is called the adjacent side, therefore OB
    is the adjacent side.

We work with the ratios of the sides of the triangle:

- The ratio

```
opposite
_________hypotenuse is called sine θ (abbreviated to sin θ)
```
- The ratio

```
adjacent
_________hypotenuse is called cosine θ (abbreviated to cos θ)
```
- The ratio

```
opposite
_______adjacent is called tangent θ (abbreviated to tan θ)
```
Therefore sin θ =

```
opposite side
__________hypotenuse = AB/AO
```
cos θ =

```
adjacent side
__________hypotenuse = OB /AO
```
tan θ =

```
opposite side
__________adjacent side = AB/OB

We can also place the same triangle on the Cartesian plane in
standard position, with a vertex at the origin and one side on
the _x_ -axis like this:

- On the Cartesian plane, A is the point ( _x_ ; _y_ ).
- The angle A ^
    O B or θ is positive (we rotate in an anti-clockwise
direction)
- The length of OB is _x_ units and the length of AB is _y_ units.
- We can find the length of AO, using the Theorem of Pythagoras.

```
In ΔABO, AO^2 = AB^2 + OB^2
```
```
AO^2 = x^2 + y^2
```
```
r^2 = x^2 + y^2
```
```
Now we can name the trigonometric ratios
in terms of x , y and r.
```
- The ratio

```
y
_ r is called sin θ
```
- The ratio _x_ _ _r_ is called cos θ
- The ratio

```
y
_ x is called tan θ
```
```
Learn these ratios:
```
```
sin θ = y _ r = ________hypotenuseopposite cos θ = x _ r = ________hypotenuseadjacent tan θ = y _ x = ______oppositeadjacent

2. Special trig ratios using an equilateral triangle
We use an equilateral triangle that has sides of 2 units to find the
    trig ratios for the special angles 30° and 60°. The perpendicular
    bisector of one side creates two triangles. The angles of an
    equilateral triangle are
    equal, so angles P, Q
    and R are each 60°.
P is bisected, so QPS ^
    = RPS^ = 30°.
By Pythagoras,
PR^2 = PS^2 + RS^2
22 = PS^2 + 1^2
PS^2 = 4 – 1 = 3

b) Angles greater than 360°
We can add or subtract 360° (or multiples of 360°) and will always
end up with an angle in the first revolution. For example, 390° can
be written as (30° + 360°), so 390° has the same terminal arm as
30°.
c) Negative angles:
```
- (–θ) lies in quadrant IV and is the same as 360° – θ.
sin(–θ) = –sin θ cos(–θ) = cos θ tan(–θ) = –tan θ
- (θ–180)lies in the third quadrant
sin(θ –180) = -sin θ cos(θ–180) = –cos θ tan(θ–180) = tan θ
- (–θ–180)lies in the second quadrant
sin(–θ –180) = sin θ cos(–θ–180) = –cos θ tan(–θ–180) = –tan θ
- (θ–360) lies in the first quadrant
sin(θ– 360) = sin θ cos(θ–360) = –cos θ tan(θ–360) = –tan θ

d) Co-functions
In this right-angled triangle, the sides are a , b and c and ^
B = θ.
A = 90° and angles of a triangle are supplementary
∴ ^
C = (90° – θ).
Look at the sine and cosine ratios for the triangle:
sin θ = __ ba and cos (90° – θ) = b __ a
∴ cos (90° – θ) = sin θ
cos θ = __ ca and sin (90° – θ) = __ ca
∴ sin (90° – θ) = cos θ

Trig ratios of angles that add up to 90°, are

Hints for solving
trig identities:
•	 Choose either the left-
hand side or the right-
hand side and simplify it
to look like the other side.
•	 If both sides look difficult,
you can try to simplify on
both sides until you reach
a point where both sides
are the same.
•	 It is usually helpful to
write tan θ as sin ____cosθθ.
•	 Sometimes you need to
simplify ____cos sin θθ to tan θ.
•	 If you have sin^2 _x_ or cos^2 _x_
with +1 or –1, use the
squares identities
(sin^2 θ + cos^2 θ = 1).
•	 Find a common
denominator when
fractions are added or
subtracted.
•	 Factorise if necessary –
specify with examples i.e.
common factor, DOPS,
Trinomial, sum/diff of two
cubes

## 10.9 Solving trigonometric equations

```
To solve a trig equation where the angle is unknown, you need to find all the possible values of
the angle.
```
```
For example, if sin θ = __^12 , we know that θ could be 30°. However, there are other values for θ in
the other quadrants. Have a look at the graph for sin
θ = __^12 , θ ∈ [–360°; 720°].
```
```
There are six values for θ between –360° and 720°.
```
```
y y = sin x
```
```
y = 0,5
```
_-_ 0,5

```
–1
```
```
1
```
```
0,5
```
```
–360° –270° –180° –90° 90 ° 180 ° 270 ° 360 ° 450 ° 540 ° 630 ° 720 ° x
```
```
If 30° is our reference angle in quadrant I.
```
```
In quadrant II: sin (180° – 30°) = sin 30° = __^12 So θ is 150°
In quadrant III and IV, the sine ratio is negative, so there is no solution
for θ.
The angle could be greater than 360°.
In quadrant I: sin (360° + 30°) = sin 30° = __^12 So θ is 390°
In quadrant II: sin (540° – 30°) = sin ((540° – 360°) – 30°)
= sin (180° – 30°) = sin 30 =^1 __ 2 So θ is 510°
You can also work out that θ = –210° or θ = –330°
```
```
You do not need to draw a graph to solve these equations.
```
```
A method to find the general solution of trig equations:
```
1. Isolate the trig function on one side of the equation.
2. Determine the reference angle: put the positive number for the angle in the calculator and press the trig key and the
    inverse key:
shift sin / shift cos /shift tan.
Use special angles if the question does not allow you to use a calculator.
3. For sin x and cos x, place the reference angle in the two possible quadrants where they are positive or negative
    (according to the question). The period of the sine and cosine graphs is 360°, so add k 360° to each solution.
    Always put _k_ ∈핑.
4. For tan x, place the reference angle in one correct quadrant where it is positive or negative (according to the question).
    The period of the tan graph is 180°, so add k 180°. Always put _k_ ∈핑.
5. If x must be solved for a given interval:
    a) Find the general solution
    b) Substitute k with –1; 0; 1; 2, etc. to find the solutions in the correct interval.

**1.** Solve for _x_ : sin _x_ = 0,7 [On your calculator, press: sin–1 0,7 =]
The calculator answer is 44,42......°
We call this the **reference angle** , as it is not the only solution to the
    equation.
sin _x_ is positive, so angle _x_ must be in quadrant I or quadrant II in
    the first revolution.
In quadrant I: _x_ = 44,42....... °
**AND**
In quadrant II: _x_ = 180° – 44,42....° = 135,57........ °
The period of the sin graph is 360°, so the other points of
    intersection occur 360° to the right or left of these solutions.
We add _k_ revolutions to the two angles in the first revolution.
_k_ is an integer (...–1; 0; 1; ...). We call this **the general solution** of the
    equation.
So we can say the solution to **sin x = 0,7** is
_x_ = 44,42° + _k_ 360° or _x_ = 135,57° + _k_ 360°; _k_ ∈핑.
(Correct to two decimal place)
**2.** Solve for _x_ : sin _x_ = –0,7
This time, place the reference angle in quadrants III and IV (sin _x_ is

_x_ = 180°+ 44,42.....°+ _k_ 360° or _x_ = 360°– 44,42.....°+ _k_ 360° _k_ ∈핑
_x_ = 224,42° + _k_ 360° or _x_ = 315,57° + _k_ 360; _k_ ∈핑
(Correct to two decimal place)
**3.** Solve for _x_ : cos _x_ = –0,7 Reference angle = 134,427....°
cos _x_ is negative in quadrants II and III.
_x_ = 360° – 134,43° = 225,57°
_x_ = 134,43° + _k_ 360° or _x_ = 225,57° + _k_ 360°; _k_ ∈핑
(Correct to two decimal place)
**4.** Solve for _x_ : cos _x_ = 0,7 Reference angle = 45,57......°
This time, place the reference angle in quadrants I and IV where
    cos _x_ is positive:
_x_ = 45,57....° + _k_ 360° or _x_ = 360° – 45,57......° + _k_ 360°
_x_ = 45,57° + _k_ 360° or _x_ = 314,43° + _k_ 360°; _k_ ∈핑.
(Correct to two decimal place)
**5.** Solve for _x_ : tan _x_ = 0,7
tan _x_ is positive in quadrants I and III.
Reference angle = 34,99° (correct to 2 dec places)
_x_ = 34,99....° or 180° + 34,99......° = 214,99.......°
Now the period of the tan graph is 180°, so the other points
    of intersection occur 180° to the right or left of the solutions.
_x_ = 34,99° + _k_ 180°; _k_ ∈핑
(Correct to two decimal place)
**6.** Solve for _x_ : tan _x_ = –0,7
tan _x_ is negative in quadrants II and IV.
The reference angle is –34,99......°
180° – 34,99.......° = 145,01.....°
_x_ = 145,01° + _k_ 180°; _k_ ∈핑.

```
You do not need to write
down the solution of 215°.
This solution is already there
because
34,99° + (1)180° = 215°

## 10.11 Compound and double angle identities

```
sin (20° + 30°) ≠ sin 20° + sin 30°
```
```
When two angles are added or subtracted to form a new angle, then a
compound or a double angle is formed.
Sketch 1 Sketch 2 Sketch 3
```
```
A D F E P S
```
β β (^) α
α α α
B C G H T R
Sketch 1 : The compound angle _A
^
B C_ is equal to the sum of α and β
eg. 75° = 45° + 30°
Sketch 2 : The compound angle _E
^
G H_ is equal to the difference between
α and β
eg. 15° = 60° – 45° or 15° = 45° – 30°
Sketch 3 : The double angle _P
^
T R_ is equal to the sum of α and α
eg. 45° = 22,5° + 22,5°
Using the same methods as we did to establish the reduction formulae, we
can also establish the compound angle identities.
Given any angles α and β, we can find the values of the sine and cosine
ratios of the angles α + β, α – β and 2α.
sin (α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β
sin (α – β) = sin α cos β – cos α sin β
cos (α + β) = cos α cos β – sin α sin β
cos (α – β) = cos α cos β + sin α sin β
sin 2α = 2sin α cos α
cos 2α = cos^2 α – sin^2 α
= 2cos^2 α – 1
= 1 – 2 sin^2 α
These formulae are provided on
the information sheet in the final
exam.
You should learn these formulae,
as you will use them often.

cos(α – β) = cosα.cosβ + sinα.sinβ,
and derive the other compound angle identities
```
```
These are examinable, learn them well.
```
```
Proof:
cos(α + β) = cos[α – (–β)] = cosα.cos(–β) + sinα.sin(–β)
= cosα.cosβ + sinα.(–sinβ)
= cosα.cosβ – sinα.sinβ
```
```
Proof:
sin(α + β) = cos[90° – (α + β)] = cos[90° – α – β] = cos[(90° – α) – β]
= cos(90° – α). cos(β) + sin(90° – α). sin(β)
= sinα.cosβ + cosα.sinβ
```
```
Proof:
sin(α – β) = cos[90° – (α – β)] = cos[90° – α + β] = cos[(90° + β) – α]
= cos(90° + β). cosα + sin(90° + β). sinα

a) sin 2 x. cos 10° – cos 2 x. sin 10° = cos 3 x use compound angle identity
∴ sin (2 x – 10°) 3 = cos 3 x use co-functions
∴ sin (2 x – 10°) = sin (90° – 3 x ) 3
∴ 2 x – 10° = 90°–3 x + k 360° 3 or 2 x –10° = 180°–(90°–3 x ) + k 360° 3 k ∈핑
∴ 5 x = 100° + k 360° 3 2 x – 10° = 90° + 3 x + k 360°
∴ x = 20° + k 72° 3 – x = 100 + k 360° 3
x = –100 – k 360 3 k ∈핑 (8)
```
```
b) cos^2 x = 3 sin 2 x use double angles for sin 2 x
cos^2 x = 3(2 sin x .cos x ) 3 make LHS = 0
cos^2 x – 3(2 sin x .cos x ) = 0 multiply out
cos^2 x – 6 sin x .cos x = 0 3 common factor
cos x (cos x – 6 sin x ) 3 = 0
∴ cos x = 0 3 or cos x – 6 sin x = 0 3
cos x = 0 or ____cos cos xx = 6 sin _____cos xx
cos x = 0 or 1 = 6 tan x
cos x = 0 or tan x = 1 __ 6 3
Reference angle = 90° or reference angle = 9,46°
∴ x = 90° + k 360° 3 or x = 360°–90° + k 360° or x = 9,46° + k 180° 3 k ∈핑
x = 270° + k 360° 3 or x = 180° + 9,46° + k 360° 3 k ∈핑

For which values of x is this identity undefined? ____tan^1 x + tan x = ____tan sin 2 xx
[4]
```
```
Solution
```
```
____tan^1 x + tan x = _____tan sin 2 xx is undefined if tan x = 0 or if sin² x = 0 or if tan x is
undefined
```
```
[division by 0 is undefined]
if tan x = 0 OR if sin² x = 0 OR tan x is undefined
x = 0° + k 180° 3 OR sin x = 0 33 x = 90° + k 180° 3 (4)
x = 0° + k 360° OR x = 180° + k 360°
So the identity is undefined for x = 0° + k 360° or x = 180° + k 360°
or x = 90° + k 180°
All these solutions are the same as x = 0° + k 90° for k ∈핑.

```
```
•	 any number________ 0 is undefined.
Therefore if the
denominator of an identity
= 0, then the identity is
undefined
•	 y = tan x is undefined
for certain value of x.
Therefore if a tan function
is in an identity then
the identity is undefined
where the tan function is
undefined.

Trigonometry: Sine,

cosine and area rules

```
We use these three rules to find the lengths of sides, sizes of angles and the area
of any kind of triangle. To ‘solve a triangle’ means you must calculate the unknown
sides and angles.
```
## 11.1 Right-angled triangles

```
You can use the trig ratios to find angles and lengths of a right-angled triangle.
```
Activity 1

```
In triangle ABC, ^
B = 37° and
AC = 16 cm. ^

length of AB and BC (correct to

```
16 cm
```
### 37 °

**11** Unit

```
Solution
To calculate the length of AB, use 37° as the reference angle, then
AC = 16 cm is the opposite side and AB is the hypotenuse. Use the sine ratio.
sin 37° =
```
```
opp
___hyp = ___AB^16
```
```
AB sin 37° = 16
AB = _____sin37°^16 = 26,6 cm 3
To find the length of BC, you can use
cos 37° =
```
```
adj
___hyp = BC/26.6
```
```
26,6 cos 37° = BC 3
BC = 21,2 cm (to one decimal place) 3
You can also use Pythagoras’ theorem:
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 [3]

If a base or height is unknown, you can use trig ratios to work
them out. If the perpendicular height is not given and cannot be
worked out, then we need a different area formula.
There is a formula that works to find the area of any triangle, even if we do not know
the perpendicular height.
The area of any ∆ABC is half the product of two sides and sine of the included angle.
A
```
### C B

```
b
```
```
a
```
```
c
```
```
So if you choose to use angle A, then
Area ∆ABC = 1 _ 2 bc sin A
If you choose to use angle B, then
Area ∆ABC = 1 _ 2 ac sin B
If you choose to use angle C, then
Area ∆ABC = 1 _ 2 ab sin C
Learn one form of the formula – you can work out the others from that.
To find the area of any triangle, you need to know the lengths of two sides and the
size of the angle between the two sides.

## 11.3 Sine rule

```
If you have enough information about the sides and angles of any triangle,
you can use the sine rule to find the other sides and angles.
```
```
Sine rule
```
```
The ratio of sine of the angle divided
by the side opposite that angle is
the same for all three pairs of sides
and angles.
```
```
So ...
```
```
In any triangle ABC:
```
```
____sin A a = ____sin B b = sin C____ c
We can also use the ratios with the sides in the numerator:
```
```
____sin A a = ____sin B b = ____sin C c
The formula will be provided on the information sheet

__^12 bc sin A = __^12 ab sin C = 1 __ 2 ac sin B
```
```
Dividing each by^1 __ 2 abc results: ____sin A a = ____sin C c = sin B____ b
```
```
To use the sine rule you need to know at least one side and its matching opposite angle and one more side or angle.

You apply the cosine rule If you are given the values of:
```
- two sides and the included angle OR
- three sides of a triangle,

```
Cosine rule:
In any triangle ABC:
```
```
If you choose to use angle A, then
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 – 2 bc cos A
```
```
If you choose to use angle B, then
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 – 2 ac cos B
```
```
If you choose to use angle C, then
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 – 2 ab cos C

In Δ BDC: a^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 (Pythagoras Theorem)

But BD^2 + AD^2 = c^2 (Pythagoras Theorem)
```
```
Thus a^2 = b 2 + c 2 − 2 b AD ..........................(1)

```
In Δ ABD: cosA = ___AD c ∴ AD = c cos A ...........(2)
```
```
Substituting (2) into (1)
∴ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 − 2 bc cosA

```
Similarly it can be shown that:
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 − 2 ac cosB and

**1.** Solve ΔPQR if _q_ = 462 mm, _p_ = 378 mm and ^
    R = 87°.

```
Using the cosine rule
(two sides and the included angle are given so you can
find the side opposite the given angle)
PQ^2 = p^2 + q^2 – 2 pq cos R
PQ^2 = (378)^2 + (462)^2 – 2(378)(462).cos 87°
PQ^2 = 338 048,5159
PQ = 581,42 mm [take square root]

```
Using the sine rule:
```
```
____sin P^378 =

**1.** PQRS is a trapezium with PQ // SR, PQ = PS, SR = 10 cm,
QR = 7 cm, ^
    R = 63°.
Calculate:
**a)** SQ (2)
**b)** PS (6)
**c)** area of quadrilateral
    PQRS. (correct to 2
decimal places) (5)
    **[13]**

```
Solutions
a) In Δ QSR, you know two sides and the included angle, so use the cosine
rule.
SQ² = 7² + 10² – 2(7)(10)cos 63° 3
SQ² = 85,44... find the square root
SQ = 9,24 cm 3 (2)
```
```
b) In Δ PQS, you know that PQ = PS and you worked out that SQ = 9,24 cm.
Think about the question first
If you can find ^
P then you can use the sine rule to find PS.
To find ^
P , you need to first find P
```
```
^
Q S or P
```
```
^
S Q.
P ^
Q S = P ^
S Q (alternate angles, PQ // SR)
Now can you work out a value for Q ^
S R?
In ΔQSR, you know three sides and ^
R.
So it is easiest to use the sine rule to find Q
```
```
^
S R.
sin Q ^
S R
______ 7 = _____sin 63°9,24 3
```
```
sin Q ^
S R = 7 sin 63°______9,24 = 0.675004
∴ Q ^
S R = 42,45° 3
P ^
Q S= Q ^
S R = 42,45° (alternate angles, PQ // SR)
P
```
```
^
Q S= P
```
```
^
S Q = 42,45° (base angles of isosceles Δ)
∴ ^
P = (180° – (42,45° + 42,45°) 3
= 95,1° 3 (sum angles in Δ)
```
```
Now we can find PS using the sine rule and ^
P.
In ΔPQS _______sin 42,45°PS = ______ sin 95,19,24 3
```
```
PS = 9,24 ___________sin 95,1sin 42,45°
PS = 6,26 cm 3 (6)
```
```

c) To find the areas of PQRS, find the area of the two triangles and add
them together.
To find the area of ΔPQS, use ^

Euclidean Geometry

12.1 Revise:

Proportion and area

of triangles

1. Ratio and proportion

Ratio compares two measurements of the same kind using the same units.

example

If Line A is 2 units long and Line B is 6 units long, then the ratio of
Line A : Line B is 2 : 6.

This is the same ratio as 1 : 3. Line C is 1 unit long and Line D is 3 units
long.

So Line C : Line D is 1 : 3. So C and D are in the same proportion as A and B.

```
A
```
```
B
```
```
C
```
```
D
```
So the two ratios are equal and we can say that __BA = __CD

We say that A, B, C and D are in proportion.

This proportion can be written in many ways:

If A__B = __CD , then 1. __AC = __BD 2. B__A = __DC 3. C__A = __DB

```
Ratio and proportion of areas and sides of triangles
```
1. If two or more triangles have a common vertex (A) and lie between
    the same parallel lines, they also have a common perpendicular
    height (altitude).

```
B C D E
```
2. The areas of triangles with equal altitudes
    are in the same proportion as their bases.
Remember: area Δ = ½ base × perp
    height
ΔADB, ΔDBC and ΔADC all have the
same ⊥ height DE.
So Area ΔADB : Area ΔDBC : Area
    ΔADC
(½ AB × DE) : (½ BC × DE) : (½ AC × DE) AB : BC : AC
3. If two or more triangles lie
    between parallel lines, they
    have the same altitude.
4. Triangles on the same base
    (or equal bases) and between
    parallel lines are equal in area.
Area ΔABC = ½(AB) _h_
Area ΔADB = ½(AB) _h_
Area ΔABC = Area ΔADB

## 12.2 Proportion theorems

```
Theorem 7 (Learn the proof for the examination)
Proportional Theorem
```
```
If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides in the same proportion.
(Prop theorem, DE ∣∣ BC)
```
```
Given: Triangle ABC with D on AB and E on AC, DE ∣∣ BC
To prove: AD__DB = __AEEC
```
```
Proof: Construction: Draw altitudes h and k in ΔADE
Join DC and BE
_________Area of ∆ADEArea of ∆BDE = _____½.AD.½.DB. hh = __ADDB (same altitude h )
```
```
and _________Area of ∆ ADEArea of ∆ CED = ½.AE._____½.EC. kk = __AEEC (same altitude k )
```
```
but Area ΔADE = Area ΔCED (same base DE; same altitude; DE ∣∣ BC)
```
```
∴ Area of _________Area of ΔΔ ADE BDE = Area of _________Areaof ΔΔ CED ADE
```
```
∴ AD__DB = __AEEC

Statistics

```
Data handling is the study of statistics, or data. We collect, organise, analyse
and interpret data. The data can inform students, researchers, advertising and
business.
```
```
It can provide us with an understanding of social issues and human trends. Then
we can make informed decisions when we plan for the future, or make a new
advertisement, or address social issues.
```
```
We usually collect data from a fairly small group (called the sample). The sample
must be big enough and it must be randomly chosen from the population. This
is to make sure that it fairly represents the trends in the larger group of people
(called the population).

## 13.2 Measures of central tendency

```
13.2.1 Ungrouped Data
Measures of central tendency are different measures of finding the
‘middle’ or ‘average’ of a set of data. The three kinds of ‘middle’ of a set of
data that we use are the mean, the median and the mode.
```
```
It is advisable that we start by arranging the set of data in an ascending
order before attempting questions.
```
1. Mean
The mean of the data is the average if you add all the values and
    divide by the number of values. We use the symbol for the mean.

```
mean ( –^ x ) =
```

In a Mathematics class, 23 learners completed a test out of 25 marks. Here is a list of their results:
```
```
14; 10; 23; 21; 11; 19; 13; 13; 20; 21; 9; 13; 17; 17; 18; 14; 19; 13; 24; 21; 9; 16; 6.
```
```
Calculate the median of this data.
```
```
Solution
•	 First put the data in order, from lowest to highest.
6; 9; 9; 10; 11; 13; 13; 13; 13; 14; 14; 16; 17; 17; 18; 19; 19; 20; 21; 21; 21; 23; 24.
There are 23 numbers, so the middle number is the12th number out of 23 numbers. So 16 is the
median, the number in the middle of the data.
•	 When there is an even number of values in the data set, the median lies halfway between the middle
two values.
•	 We can add these two values and divide by 2. For [Example], what if another learner wrote the test
and her result was 7? We can add this to the ordered data set.
```
```
6; 7; 9; 9; 10; 11; 13; 13; 13; 13; 14; 14; 16; 17; 17; 18; 19; 19; 20; 21; 21; 21; 23; 24.
```
```
Now there are 24 numbers and the middle two numbers are the 12th and 13th numbers. The middle
two numbers are 14 and 16. Add 14 and 16 to get 30 and divide by 2 to get a median of 15.
```
```
_____14+16 2 = 15
```
3. Mode
The mode is the number or value that appears most frequently in the
    data set.

## 13.3 Measures of dispersion (or spread)

```
The measures of dispersion give us information about how spread out
the data is around the median. The measures of central tendency give us
information about the central point of the data, but we still need to know if
the data is concentrated in one place, or evenly spread out.
```
```
We first look at these measures of dispersion: range and interquartile
range.
```
1. Range
The range is the difference between the highest value (or maximum)
    and the lowest value (or minimum) in a data set.

```
Range = largest value in the data set – smallest value in the data set
```
6

```
Find the range of the Mathematics test results:
6; 9; 9; 10; 11; 13; 13; 13; 13; 14; 14; 16; 17; 17; 18; 19; 19;
20; 21; 21; 21; 23; 24.
```
```
Solution
```
```
24 – 6 = 18. So the range of the test results is 18.
```
2. the interquartile range
- The interquartile range depends on the median. So organise the data
    first and find the median.
- The data is divided into four parts (quarters, which we call quartiles).
    First, the median (Q 2 ) divides the data into two halves.
- The lower quartile (Q 1 ) divides the data below the median (Q 2 ) into
    two equal sets of data.
- The upper quartile (Q 3 ) divides the data above the median into two
    equal sets of data.
- The difference between the lower and the upper quartile (Q 3 – Q 1 )
    is called the interquartile range. This tells us how spread out the
    middle half of the data is around the median.

•	 We already know that the median is 16.
•	 Lower half of the data has 11scores, so Q 1 is the 6th data item.
∴ Q 1 = 13
•	 Upper half of the data set has 11 scores, so Q 3 is the 6th score
of the upper half data set ∴ Q 3 = 20

is 20
```
```
Solution
We already know that the middle two numbers are 14 and 16.
•	 The data set has an even number of points, so the median will lie between 14 and 16 ( 3 ). Use the
lower value 14 in the lower half and the upper value 16 in the upper half. ( 3 )
•	 Lower half: 12 numbers, so use the 6th and 7th numbers to find the lower quartile. ______ 11 + 13 2 = 12 ( 3 )
```
```
•	 Upper half: 12 numbers, so use the 6th and 7th numbers to find the upper quartile. ______19 + 20 2 = 19,5 ( 3 )

upper 50%.

Skewed to the right (Positively skewed) means that the upper half of the
data is more spread out than the lower half.
```
```
Skewed data
A box and whisker plot can show whether a data set is symmetrical,
positively skewed or negatively skewed. This box and whisker plot is
not symmetrical because the whiskers are not the same length and the
median is not in the centre of the box. The whisker on the left is a bit longer
than the whisker on the right, which shows that the data on the left of the
box is more spread out. The box is also longer to the right of the median
than to the left of the median. We say that the data is negatively skewed.
(or skewed to the left).

Determine whether the minimum in the [Example] above is an outlier or
not.
```
```
Solution
Inter-quartile range = Q 3 – Q 1
= 20 – 13
= 7
Q 1 – 1,5 × IQR = 13 – 1,5 × 7
= 2,5
6 > 2,5 ∴ 6 is not an outlier
```
```
To determine outliers:
•	 Determine the interquartile range
•	 Determine Q 1 – 1,5 × IQR
•	 If the minimum < the value of Q 1 – 1,5 × IQR, then it is an outlier.
•	 Determine Q 3 – 1,5 × IQR
•	 If the maximum > Q 3 – 1,5 × IQR,
Then it is an outlier.

## 13.5 Histograms and frequency polygons

- Histograms and frequency polygons are graphs used to represent
    grouped and continuous data. They show the frequency and the
    distribution (spread) of the data.
- Continuous data is data that is not just measured in whole numbers.
    For example, length, mass, volume or time are measured in
    continuous amounts.
- The horizontal axis of a histogram and a frequency polygon have a
    continuous scale.
- The vertical axis shows the frequency, or number of times the data is
    listed.
1. Grouped data:
Instead of recording every piece of data separately, we can group the
    data to make it easier to read. Grouped data can be represented on
    a histogram or a frequency polygon.

A grocer wants to record the mass of each packet of chicken pieces he
sells. He groups the masses into intervals of 0,2 kg. He makes a frequency
table.
```
```
These 8 packets have any mass
between a bit more than 1,2 kg
and 1,4 kg.
So 1,2 < mass of chicken < 1,4
```
```
Mass of chicken in kg Number
0,8 < mass of chicken ≤ 1,0 0
1,0 < mass of chicken ≤ 1,2 3
1,2 < mass of chicken ≤ 1,4 8
1,4 < mass of chicken ≤ 1,6 6
1,6 < mass of chicken ≤ 1,8 2
1,8 < mass of chicken ≤ 2,0 1
2,0 < mass of chicken ≤ 2,2 0

```
3. Frequency polygons
We can also make a frequency polygon using this data. A frequency
    polygon uses lines to join the mid-points of each interval. The
    polygon must begin and end on the horizontal axis. So we can add an
    interval at the beginning and the end of the data which both have a
    frequency of 0.

A histogram is a graphical
display of data using bars of
different heights. It is similar to
a bar graph but for a histogram
there are no gaps between the
bars.

Notice the polygon shape. This

Frequency polygons are useful to compare the distribution of two or more
sets of data on the same set of axes.
```
```
To plot a frequency polygon:
•	 Plot midpoints of each interval
•	 Join the midpoints by straight lines
•	 Add an interval at the beginning and end of the data, with both frequencies
equals to 0.
•	 Frequency polygon is a closed figure, hence must start and end at the
x -axis.

2. Cumulative frequency graph (ogive)
    - We can represent the cumulative results from a cumulative
       frequency table with a cumulative frequency graph or ogive.
    - This graph always starts on the x-axis and usually forms an
       S-shaped curve, ending with the cumulative frequency ( _y_ -value).
    - The endpoint of each interval is plotted against the cumulative
       frequency.

variance and the standard deviation.
```
1. Standard deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of (the sum of the squared
    differences between each score and the mean divided by the
    number of scores). The formula for standard deviation is:

σ = √

```
_______
∑ ( x –
```
-^ _x_ ) 2
_______ _n_ where _x_ is each individual value, –
_x_  is the mean and _n_ is the number
of values. The symbol sigma ∑ means ‘the sum of’.
This formula will be on the data sheet. Make sure you can use the formula properly.

```
1.1 Calculating the standard deviation using the formula:
```
σ = √

```
_______
∑( x – –^ x )^2
_______ n
```
1. Find the mean of all the numbers in the data set.
2. Find each value of _x_ – –^ _x_. In other words, work out by how much each of these
    values differs (or deviates) from the mean.
3. Square each deviation. Find each value of ( _x_ – –^ _x_ )^2
4. Add all the answers together. In other words, find ∑ ( _x_ –^ _x_ – )^2.
5. Divide this sum by the number of values, _n_.
6. You have now found ∑^1 ( _x_ –

–^ _x_ ) (^2)
_______ _n_. This value is called the variance.

7. Find the square root of the variance to find the standard deviation. √

```
_______
∑( x –
```
-^ _x_ ) 2
______ _n_

```
By working through these steps, you have found the standard deviation using the
formula.

1.2 Steps for calculating the standard deviation with a scientific
calculator:
Using a Casio fx –82 ES PLUS calculator:
press Mode then StAt then 1 – VAR
```
- enter all data one at a time pressing = after each entry.
- press the orange AC button
- press shift StAt then VAR
- in order to calculate the mean press 2: –^ **_x_**.
- once all these steps have been completed, simply press AC shift
    StAt then VAR
- now press 3: σ to calculate the standard deviation.

```
If you understand the calculator steps and use them properly,
you will come to the same answer of 15,75 as we found before.
Practise these steps so that you can do exam Examples using a
calculator.
```
```
•	 the interquartile range measures a spread around the median, so it has to do with
the positions of data and not their actual values.
•	 the standard deviation measures a spread around the mean, using the actual
values of the data and not just their positions.

```
(a) Mean = ____^550010 = 550 kilocalories 33 (2)
(b) σ = 69,03 kilocalories 33 (2)
(c) Snack foods have a greater variation. 3 The standard deviation for
snack foods is 69,03 kilocalories whilst the standard deviation for
breakfast cereals is 28 kilocalories. i.e energy levels of breakfast cereals
is spread closer to the mean than in those of the snack food. 3 (2)

2. The normal distributive curve
The data can be plotted on a graph that shows the standard
    deviations. If the data is distributed symmetrically around the mean,
    the values form a normal distribution curve:

## 13.8 Bivariate data and the scatter plot (scatter graph)

- A scatter plot is a graph using the _x_ - and _y_ -axes to represent bivariate
    data.
- Bivariate data means that each point on the graph represents two
    variables that are independent of each other.
- In a scatter plot, we plot a point for each pair of coordinates and look
    at the overall pattern or trend in the data.
- The points in the data are compared to see if there is a correlation or
    some kind of pattern (or trend) in the data.
- When a point does not fit the trend of the other points, it is called an
    outlier.
- Outliers are easy to identify on a scatter diagram or a box and
    whisker diagram.
- We can sometimes represent the trend in the data with a line
    or curve of best fit. The line or curve can be represented by an
    equation that could be linear, quadratic, exponential, hyperbolic etc.

13.9 The linear regression

## regression line) 13.9 The linear regression line (or the least squares

regression line)

```
The line of best fit for a set of bivariate numerical data is the linear
regression line. So far, we have seen this trend line on a scatter graph.
Now we use a scientific calculator to determine the equation for this line.
```
```
We know the straight line equation: y = mx + c
```
```
Statistics (as used on the CASIO x-82ES PLUS calculator ) uses y = A + Bx,
where B is the gradient and A is the cut on the y -axis of the straight line of
best fit.
```
```
So the gradient is B instead of m and the y -intercept is A instead of c.
```
```
The Regression Coefficient ‘r’
```
```
This is a statistical number that measures the strength of the correlation
(relationship) between two sets of data.
```
- This number is calculated from two sets of data using a calculator.
- _r_ always lies between –1 and +1.
- The closer _r_ is to –1, the stronger the negative correlation.
- The closer _r_ is to +1, the stronger the positive correlation.
- If _r_ = 0, there is no correlation between the two sets of data.

```
The number line shows the r values and the strength of the correlation
between bivariate data.

What you need to be able

to do:

1. Determine mean, median and mode in grouped or ungrouped data
2. Draw and analyse the following methods for representing data:
    - box-and-whisker plots
    - histograms
    - frequency polygons
    - cumulative frequency curves (ogives)
    - Calculate the variance and the standard deviation of a set of
       ungrouped data.
    - Comment on whether a data set is symmetric or skewed, by
       analysing the representation of the data.
    - Identify outliers in a set of data by looking at the box-and-whisker
       plot or scatterplot.
    - Determine the equation of the line of best fit of bivariate data
       using a calculator. (This line could be called the “least squares
       regression line”.)
    - Determine the regression correlation coefficient _“r”_.
    - Use the line of best fit to draw conclusions.
