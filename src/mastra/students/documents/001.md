### 5. Trigonometry

You can use trigonometry to calculate the sizes of triangle sides if you do not have enough information, e.g., you do not have the sizes of at least two sides (but do have the angle).  

- **sin** = opposite / hypotenuse (sin = O/H)  
- **cos** = adjacent / hypotenuse (cos = A/H)  
- **tan** = opposite / adjacent (tan = O/A)  

It’s easiest to remember this as **SOHCAHTOA** (e.g., "soak a toe" or "soccer toe").  

The **hypotenuse** is the longest side next to the angle, usually represented with a theta (θ).  
- **Opposite**: The side of the triangle directly opposite the angle.  
- **Adjacent**: The side adjacent to (next to) the angle, that is not the hypotenuse.  

---

### Example 1: Calculating the Hypotenuse

In this triangle, the side opposite the angle θ is 3 cm long. The side adjacent to the angle θ and the hypotenuse are unknown. The angle θ is 30 degrees.  

To calculate the hypotenuse:  

1. Use the sine formula:  
   \[
   \sin θ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3 \, \text{cm}}{H}
   \]  
2. Substitute \( \sin 30° = 0.5 \):  
   \[
   0.5 = \frac{3}{H}
   \]  
3. Solve for \( H \):  
   \[
   H \times 0.5 = 3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad H = \frac{3}{0.5} = 6 \, \text{cm}
   \]  

Thus, the hypotenuse is **6 cm**.

### Example 2: Calculating the Adjacent Side

Let’s calculate the adjacent side, assuming we don’t know the hypotenuse.  

1. Use the tangent formula:  
   \[
   \tan θ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{3 \, \text{cm}}{A}
   \]  
2. Substitute \( \tan 30° = 0.57735 \):  
   \[
   0.57735 = \frac{3}{A}
   \]  
3. Solve for \( A \):  
   \[
   A = \frac{3}{0.57735} \approx 5.2 \, \text{cm}
   \]  

Thus, the adjacent side is approximately **5.2 cm**.  

---

### Example 3: Verifying with Pythagoras

To verify, use the Pythagorean theorem:  
\[
A^2 + O^2 = H^2
\]  

1. Substitute \( A = 5.2 \), \( O = 3 \), and \( H = 6 \):  
   \[
   5.2^2 + 3^2 = 6^2
   \]  
2. Simplify:  
   \[
   27 + 9 = 36
   \]  
3. Verify:  
   \[
   36 = 36
   \]  

Thus, the trigonometric calculation is correct.

### Additional Trigonometric Operations

There are three other operations in trigonometry, which are the inverses of sine, cosine, and tangent:  

- **Cosecant (csc)**: Reciprocal of sine (\( \text{csc} = \frac{\text{H}}{\text{O}} \))  
- **Secant (sec)**: Reciprocal of cosine (\( \text{sec} = \frac{\text{H}}{\text{A}} \))  
- **Cotangent (cot)**: Reciprocal of tangent (\( \text{cot} = \frac{\text{A}}{\text{O}} \))

### Example 4: Astronomical Calculation

The Earth orbits the sun at a distance of approximately 149,597,870.7 km (1 astronomical unit or AU). Suppose that on December 21, an unknown object is observed at an angle of 88° to the ecliptic, and on June 21, the same object is observed at 92°.  

To calculate the distance of the unknown object in AU:  

1. Ignore extra information. The angle to the unknown object relative to the Earth is the same in both cases.  
2. Draw a triangle where:  
   - The sun is the right angle.  
   - The Earth is at the tip of the hypotenuse.  
   - The unknown object is opposite the sun.  

3. Use the sine formula:  
   \[
   \sin θ = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]  
4. Substitute \( \sin 2° = 0.035 \):  
   \[
   0.035 = \frac{1 \, \text{AU}}{H}
   \]  
5. Solve for \( H \):  
   \[
   H = \frac{1}{0.035} = 28.6 \, \text{AU}
   \]  

Thus, the unknown object is approximately **28.6 AU** away.

### Notes

- **SOHCAHTOA** is a helpful mnemonic for remembering trigonometric ratios.  
- Always verify calculations using Pythagoras or other methods when possible.  
- Trigonometric operations like cosecant, secant, and cotangent are useful for advanced calculations.
