1. INTRODUCTION

The Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS) for Mathematics outlines the nature and purpose of the subject Mathematics, guiding the philosophy underlying its teaching and assessment in Grade 12.

The purpose of these Examination Guidelines is to:

- Provide clarity on the depth and scope of the content to be assessed in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate Examination in Mathematics.
- Assist teachers in adequately preparing learners for the examinations.

This document focuses on the final Grade 12 external examinations. It does not cover school-based assessment (SBA), performance assessment tasks (PATs), or final external practical examinations in detail, as these are addressed in a separate PAT document updated annually.

These guidelines should be read alongside:

- The National Curriculum Statement (NCS) Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement (CAPS): Mathematics.
- The National Protocol of Assessment: An addendum to the policy document, the National Senior Certificate: A qualification at Level 4 on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), regarding the National Protocol for Assessment (Grades R–12).
- National policy pertaining to the programme and promotion requirements of the National Curriculum Statement, Grades R to 12.

Included in this document is a list of Euclidean Geometry reasons to guide the teaching of Euclidean Geometry.

The Information Sheet for Papers 1 and 2 is also included in this document.

3. ELABORATION OF CONTENT/TOPICS

The purpose of the clarification of the topics is to give guidance to the teacher in terms of depth of
content necessary for examination purposes. Integration of topics is encouraged as learners should
understand Mathematics as a holistic discipline. Thus questions integrating various topics can be
asked.

FUNCTIONS

1. Candidates must be able to use and interpret functional notation. In the teaching process learners

```
must be able to understand how f(x) has been transformed to generate f(x), f(x),
f(xa) f(x)a, af(x) and xf(y) where aR.
```
2. Trigonometric functions will ONLY be examined in PAPER 2.

NUMBER PATTERNS, SEQUENCES AND SERIES

1. The sequence of first differences of a quadratic number pattern is linear. Therefore, knowledge

```
of linear patterns can be tested in the context of quadratic number patterns.
```
2. Recursive patterns will not be examined explicitly.
3. Links must be clearly established between patterns done in earlier grades.

FINANCE, GROWTH AND DECAY

1. Understand the difference between nominal and effective interest rates and convert fluently

```
between them for the following compounding periods: monthly, quarterly and half-yearly or
semi-annually.
```
2. With the exception of calculating i in the Fv and Pv formulae, candidates are expected to calculate

```
the value of any of the other variables.
```
3. Pyramid schemes will NOT be examined in the examination.

ALGEBRA

1. Solving quadratic equations by completing the square will NOT be examined.
2. Solving quadratic equations using the substitution method (k-method) is examinable.
3. Equations involving surds that lead to a quadratic equation are examinable.
4. Solution of non-quadratic inequalities should be seen in the context of functions.
5. Nature of the roots will be tested intuitively with the solution of quadratic equations and in all the

```
prescribed functions.
```

```
Examination Guidelines
```
DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

1. The following notations for differentiation can be used: f'(x), Dx, dy/dx, or y'.

2. Regarding cubic functions, candidates are expected to:

   - Determine the equation of a cubic function from a given graph.
   - Discuss the nature of stationary points, including local maximum, local minimum, and points of inflection.
   - Apply knowledge of transformations on a given function to obtain its image.

3. Candidates should be able to draw and interpret the graph of the derivative of a function.

4. Surface area and volume will be examined in the context of optimization.

5. Candidates must know the formulae for the surface area and volume of right prisms. These formulae will NOT be provided on the formula sheet.

6. If the optimization question involves the surface area and/or volume of a cone, sphere, or pyramid, a list of the relevant formulae will be provided in that question. Candidates will be expected to select the correct formula from this list.

PROBABILITY

1. Dependent events are examinable but conditional probabilities are not part of the syllabus.
2. Dependent events in which an object is not replaced are examinable.
3. Questions that require the learner to count the different number of ways that objects may be

```
arranged in a circle and/or the use of combinations are not in the spirit of the curriculum.
```
4. In respect of word arrangements, letters that are repeated in the word can be treated as the same

```
(indistinguishable) or different (distinguishable). The question will be specific in this regard.
```
EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY AND MEASUREMENT

1. Measurement can be tested in the context of optimization in calculus and two- and three-dimensional trigonometry.

2. Composite shapes could be formed by combining a maximum of TWO of the stated shapes.

3. The following proofs of theorems are examinable:

   - The line drawn from the center of a circle perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord.
   - The line drawn from the center of a circle that bisects a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
   - The angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle is double the size of the angle subtended by the same arc at the circle (on the same side of the chord as the center).
   - The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary.
   - The angle between the tangent to a circle and the chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.
   - A line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle divides the other two sides proportionally.
   - Equiangular triangles are similar.

```
Examination Guidelines
```
4. Corollaries derived from the theorems and axioms are necessary in solving riders:

   - Angles in a semi-circle.
   - Equal chords subtend equal angles at the circumference.
   - Equal chords subtend equal angles at the center.
   - In equal circles, equal chords subtend equal angles at the circumference.
   - In equal circles, equal chords subtend equal angles at the center.
   - The exterior angle of a cyclic quadrilateral is equal to the interior opposite angle of the quadrilateral.
   - If the exterior angle of a quadrilateral is equal to the interior opposite angle of the quadrilateral, then the quadrilateral is cyclic.
   - Tangents drawn from a common point outside the circle are equal in length.

5. The theory of quadrilaterals will be integrated into questions in the examination.

6. Concurrency theory is excluded.

TRIGONOMETRY

1. The reciprocal ratios cosec , sec  and cot  can be used by candidates in the answering of

```
problems but will not be explicitly tested.
```
2. The focus of trigonometric graphs is on the relationships, simplification and determining points
    of intersection by solving equations, although characteristics of the graphs should not be
    excluded.

ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY

1. Prove the properties of polygons by using analytical methods.
2. The concept of collinearity must be understood.
3. Candidates are expected to be able to integrate Euclidean Geometry axioms and theorems into
    Analytical Geometry problems.

5. Concepts involved with concurrency will not be examined.

STATISTICS

1. Candidates should be encouraged to use the calculator to calculate standard deviation, variance

```
and the equation of the least squares regression line.
```
2. The interpretation of standard deviation in terms of normal distribution is not examinable.
3. Candidates are expected to identify outliers intuitively in both the scatter plot as well as the box

```
and whisker diagram.
In the case of the box and whisker diagram, observations that lie outside the interval
(lower quartile – 1,5 IQR; upper quartile + 1,5 IQR) are considered to be outliers. However,
candidates will not be penalised if they did not make use of this formula in identifying outliers.

### GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR MARKING

- If a learner makes multiple attempts at answering a question without canceling any, only the first attempt will be marked.
- Consistent accuracy marking will be applied:
  - If a variable is calculated incorrectly in one subquestion but used correctly in subsequent subquestions, full marks can be awarded for the latter if the method and calculations are correct.
  - Assuming values or answers to solve a problem is not acceptable.
