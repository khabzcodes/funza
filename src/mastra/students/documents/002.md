### Graphs

It’s probably best to start from scratch with Cartesian Coordinates.

**Coordinates** are numbers that refer to the distance of a point along a line, on a surface, or in space, from a central point called the **origin**. Graphs that you will use have only two dimensions (directions). The positions of points on these graphs are described using two coordinates:
- **x-coordinate**: How far across (left-to-right) the point is.
- **y-coordinate**: How far up-or-down the point is.

---

### Example 1: Straight Line Graph

Consider the following graph. It shows six points in a straight line.

The coordinates shown can be described using what are called **ordered pairs**. For example:
- The furthest point in this graph is 3 units across on the **x-axis** (horizontal line) and 3 units up on the **y-axis** (vertical line). Its coordinates are **(3, 3)**.
- The point just below the origin (the circle in the middle) is one unit down on the **x-axis** and one unit left on the **y-axis**. Its coordinates are **(–1, –1)**.

Anything to the left or below the origin takes a minus sign.

This series of dots looks related because they fall on a straight line. If you see a result like this in an experimental situation, it usually means you can predict the next point. For example:
- The next point would be **(4, 4)**. This kind of prediction is called **extrapolation**.
- If you carry out the experiment and find the result is **(4, 4)** and then **(5, 5)**, you’ve established a strong relation or correlation.

Another way of saying that **x** relates to **y**, or **x** is proportional to **y**, is to say that **y** is a function of **x**. This is written as **y = f(x)**. For example:
- If **y** is equal to **x**, the formula for this graph is **y = x**.

---

### Example 2: A Slightly More Complex Case

In this graph, wherever **x** is equal to something, **y** is one more. For example:
- At **x = –3**, **y = –2**.
- At **x = –2**, **y = –1**.
- At **x = –1**, **y = 0**.
- At **x = 0**, **y = 1**.
- At **x = 1**, **y = 2**.
- At **x = 2**, **y = 3**.

From this, we can see that **y = x + 1** is the formula for this line.

---

### Example 3: A Line with a Gradient

Let’s take another case. In this example:
- When **x = 1.5**, **y = 3**.
- When **x = 1**, **y = 2**.
- When **x = 0.5**, **y = 1**.

The formula for this line is **y = 2x**. The value next to **x** is called the **gradient** or **slope** of the line. The larger the gradient, the steeper the slope. The gradient is usually abbreviated as **m**.

---

### Example 4: A Line with a Gradient and Intercept

In this case, **y** is a function of **x**, but it’s not immediately obvious how they relate. For example:
- When **x = –1.5**, **y = –2**.
- When **x = –1**, **y = –1**.
- When **x = 0**, **y = 1**.

We notice that the slope is the same as the previous graph (**m = 2**), but there’s an additional constant. At the origin (**x = 0**), **y = 1**. This constant is called the **y-intercept**. The formula for this line is **y = 2x + 1**.

The general equation for a straight line is:
\[
y = mx + c
\]
where:
- **m** is the gradient (slope).
- **c** is the y-intercept (constant).

| **x**   | **y**   | **Formula**          |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| –1.5    | –2      | \( y = 2(-1.5) + 1 \) |
| –1      | –1      | \( y = 2(-1) + 1 \)   |
| –0.5    | 0       | \( y = 2(-0.5) + 1 \) |
| 0       | 1       | \( y = 2(0) + 1 \)    |
| 0.5     | 2       | \( y = 2(0.5) + 1 \)  |
| 1       | 3       | \( y = 2(1) + 1 \)    |

### Common Mistakes in Mathematics

#### 1. Exponents and Surds

1. **Correct**: \( 2^n \cdot 3^n = (2 \cdot 3)^n \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( 2^n \cdot 3^n \neq 6^n \)

2. **Correct**: \( 3^4 \cdot 3^5 = 3^9 \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( 3^4 \cdot 3^5 \neq 9^9 \)

3. **Correct**: \( 4^{10} \div 4^5 = 4^5 \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( 4^{10} \div 4^5 \neq 4^2 \)

4. **Correct**: \( (3b)^n = 3^n \cdot b^n \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( (3b)^n \neq 3 \cdot b^n \)

5. **Correct**: \( (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( (a + b)^2 \neq a^2 + b^2 \)

---

#### 2. Square Roots

1. **Correct**: \( \sqrt{16 \cdot 16} = 16 \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( \sqrt{16 \cdot 16} \neq 4 \cdot 8 \)

2. **Correct**: \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \neq a + b \)  
   Example:  
   \( \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} \neq 5 - 3 = 2 \)  
   Instead:  
   \( \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = \sqrt{25 - 9} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \)

---

#### 3. Multiplication and Division

1. **Correct**: \( 3 \cdot (-3) = -9 \)  
   **Incorrect**: \( 3 \cdot (-3) \neq 3^3 \)

---

### Notes on Surds

- A **surd** is a square root, cube root, or higher root that cannot be simplified into a rational number.  
  Examples of surds:  
  \( \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5} \)

- **Simplifying Surds**:  
  Example:  
  \( \sqrt{8} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 2} = 2\sqrt{2} \)

- **Rationalizing the Denominator**:  
  To simplify fractions with surds in the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate.  
  Example:  
  \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

---

### Key Takeaways

- Always verify calculations involving exponents and surds.
- Be cautious with square root operations; they do not distribute over addition or subtraction.
- Rationalize denominators when working with fractions containing surds.
- Follow the rules of exponents carefully to avoid common mistakes.

### Algebra

#### 1. Algebraic Expressions

Algebraic expressions are made up of constants, variables, and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).  
- **Constants**: Fixed numbers (e.g., 2, 5, -3).  
- **Variables**: Letters representing unknown values (e.g., \(x, y, a, b\)).  
- **Terms**: Parts of an expression separated by \(+\) or \(-\).  

Examples:  
- \(2x + 3y\) has two terms: \(2x\) and \(3y\).  
- \(2x(3y)\) is one term because it is a product.  
- \((2x + 3y)(2x - 3y)\) is also one term because it is a product of two expressions.

---

#### 2. Addition and Subtraction of Like Terms

- **Like Terms**: Terms with the same variables and exponents.  
- Add or subtract the coefficients of like terms.  

Examples:  
- \(3x + 5x = 8x\)  
- \(-3a + 10a = 7a\)  
- \(6x^2y + 3x - 10x^2y = -4x^2y + 3x\)  

---

#### 3. Multiplication and Division of Terms

- Multiply or divide coefficients and variables separately.  
- Use the distributive property when necessary.  

Examples:  
- \(3x \cdot 5y^2 = 15xy^2\)  
- \(-3x \cdot -5y^2 = 15xy^2\)  
- \((x + y)(a + b) = ax + bx + ay + by\)  

---

#### 4. Simplifying Fractions

- Multiply numerators and denominators.  
- Simplify if possible.  

Examples:  
- \(\frac{ab}{cd} \cdot \frac{ef}{gh} = \frac{abef}{cdgh}\)  
- \(\frac{6x}{8y} = \frac{3x}{4y}\)  

---

#### 5. Solving Equations

1. **Linear Equations**:  
   Example: Solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 7  
   \]  
   Subtract 3:  
   \[
   2x = 4  
   \]  
   Divide by 2:  
   \[
   x = 2  
   \]

2. **Quadratic Equations**:  
   Example: Solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0  
   \]  
   Factorize:  
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0  
   \]  
   Solutions:  
   \[
   x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3  
   \]

---

#### 6. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Distributive Property**:  
   Incorrect: \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2\)  
   Correct: \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\)  

2. **Division of Terms**:  
   Incorrect: \(\frac{a + b}{c} = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}\)  
   Correct: Only valid if \(c\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\).  

3. **Multiplication of Fractions**:  
   Incorrect: \(\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} \neq \frac{ac}{bd}\)  
   Correct: \(\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}\).  

---

#### 7. Key Takeaways

- Always simplify expressions step by step.  
- Factorize where possible to simplify equations.  
- Verify solutions by substituting them back into the original equation.

### Solving Quadratic Inequalities

To solve quadratic inequalities:

1. Get the inequality into the standard form:  
   \[
   ax^2 + bx + c > 0, \quad ax^2 + bx + c < 0, \quad ax^2 + bx + c \leq 0, \quad \text{or} \quad ax^2 + bx + c \geq 0
   \]

2. If the value of \(a < 0\), multiply the equation by \(-1\) (remember to reverse the inequality sign).

3. Factorize the inequality if possible, or use the quadratic formula to find the critical values.

---

### Example 1: Solve \(x^2 < 25\)

1. Rewrite the inequality:  
   \[
   x^2 - 25 < 0
   \]

2. Factorize:  
   \[
   (x - 5)(x + 5) < 0
   \]

3. Identify the critical values:  
   \[
   x = -5 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 5
   \]

4. Test intervals on the number line:  
   - Choose values less than \(-5\), between \(-5\) and \(5\), and greater than \(5\).
   - Substitute these values into the inequality to determine where it is true.

5. Solution:  
   \[
   -5 < x < 5
   \]

---

### Example 2: Solve \(2x^2 + x - 3 \geq 0\)

1. Rewrite the inequality in standard form:  
   \[
   2x^2 + x - 3 \geq 0
   \]

2. Factorize:  
   \[
   (2x + 3)(x - 1) \geq 0
   \]

3. Identify the critical values:  
   \[
   x = -\frac{3}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1
   \]

4. Test intervals on the number line:  
   - Choose values less than \(-\frac{3}{2}\), between \(-\frac{3}{2}\) and \(1\), and greater than \(1\).
   - Substitute these values into the inequality to determine where it is true.

5. Solution:  
   \[
   x \leq -\frac{3}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x \geq 1
   \]

---

### Alternative Method: Using a Rough Sketch of the Parabola

1. Draw a rough sketch of the parabola \(y = 2x^2 + x - 3\).
2. Identify where the parabola is above or below the \(x\)-axis:
   - Above the \(x\)-axis (\(y > 0\)): \(x \leq -\frac{3}{2}\) or \(x \geq 1\).
   - Below the \(x\)-axis (\(y < 0\)): Between the critical values.

---

### Key Notes

- When multiplying or dividing an inequality by a negative number, reverse the inequality sign.
- Always test intervals on the number line to determine where the inequality holds true.
- Use a rough sketch of the parabola to visualize the solution.

### 2.8 Simultaneous Equations

**Solve for x and y simultaneously:**

Given:  
1. \( y + 2x - 2 = 0 \) (Equation 1)  
2. \( 2x^2 + y^2 = 3yx \) (Equation 2)

**Steps to solve:**

1. Use the linear equation to make one of the unknowns the subject of the equation (i.e., isolate \( x \) or \( y \)).
2. Substitute the isolated variable into the quadratic equation. The equation will now contain only one unknown.
3. Solve for the unknown.
4. Substitute the solved value back into the linear equation to find the other unknown.

**Solution:**

1. From Equation 1:  
   \( y + 2x - 2 = 0 \)  
   \( \therefore y = 2 - 2x \) (Equation 3)

2. Substitute Equation 3 into Equation 2:  
   \( 2x^2 + y^2 = 3yx \)  
   \( \therefore 2x^2 + (2 - 2x)^2 = 3x(2 - 2x) \)

3. Simplify:  
   \( 2x^2 + (2 - 2x)(2 - 2x) = 3x(2 - 2x) \)  
   \( 2x^2 + 4 - 8x + 4x^2 = 6x - 6x^2 \)  
   \( 12x^2 - 14x + 4 = 0 \)  
   Divide by 2: \( 6x^2 - 7x + 2 = 0 \)  
   Factorize: \( (3x - 2)(2x - 1) = 0 \)  
   \( \therefore x = \frac{2}{3} \) or \( x = \frac{1}{2} \)

4. Substitute \( x = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into Equation 3:  
   - For \( x = \frac{2}{3} \):  
     \( y = 2 - 2\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{2}{3} \)  
     Solution: \( \left(\frac{2}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right) \)  
   - For \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):  
     \( y = 2 - 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1 \)  
     Solution: \( \left(\frac{1}{2}, 1\right) \)

---

### 2.9 The Nature of the Roots

The roots of any quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) can be determined using the discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \).

**Summary of the nature of roots:**

- If \( \Delta < 0 \): The roots are non-real (no real roots).  
- If \( \Delta = 0 \): There are two equal, real, and rational roots.  
- If \( \Delta > 0 \): There are two real roots:  
  - If \( \Delta \) is a perfect square, the roots are rational.  
  - If \( \Delta \) is not a perfect square, the roots are irrational.

**Examples:**

1. \( x = -6 \pm \sqrt{25} / 4 \):  
   \( \Delta = 25 \), \( \Delta > 0 \), and \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \).  
   Roots are real, rational, and unequal.

2. \( x = 4 \pm \sqrt{24} / 2 \):  
   \( \Delta = 24 \), \( \Delta > 0 \), but \( \sqrt{24} \) is not a perfect square.  
   Roots are real, irrational, and unequal.

3. \( x = -5 \pm \sqrt{-9} / 8 \):  
   \( \Delta = -9 \), \( \Delta < 0 \).  
   Roots are non-real.

---

### Activities

**Activity 6: Solve the following equations simultaneously.**

1. \( 2x + y = 3 \) and \( x^2 + y + x = y^2 \)  
2. \( y = \frac{x - 6}{x + 1} - 2 \) and \( y = -3x + 2 \)

**Activity 7: Determine the nature of the roots.**

1. Show that the roots of \( x^2 - 2x - 7 = 0 \) are irrational.  
2. Show that \( x^2 + x + 1 = 0 \) has no real roots.  
3. If \( x = 2 \) is a root of \( 3x^2 - 5x - 2k = 0 \), determine \( k \).  
4. For \( x = 5 \pm \sqrt{12 - 3a} \), find the value(s) of \( a \) for which the equation has equal roots.  
5. Determine the value(s) of \( k \) for which \( 3x^2 + (k + 2)x + k = 0 \) has equal roots.
